                                            Whenever Thanks giving rolls around, I know that it's not always easy to be thankful for what you have. As an entrepreneur, I have to make payroll, meet with prospects, find the time to work on my next book, and try to fit in some time for my wife, daughter, and pets.
Like many of us, I run the risk of getting too wrapped up in what I don't yet have that I might not focus on what I do have. You may know people like me, or even struggle with thankfulness yourself.
With that in mind, I try to step back and look at my favorite quotes about thankfulness to inspire me:
"Feeling gratitu0de and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it." -(William Arthur Ward)
"Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough." (-Oprah Winfrey)
"No one who achieves success does so without acknowledging the help of others. The wise and confident acknowledge this help with gratitude." -(Alfred North Whitehead)
"We would worry less if we praised more. Thanks giving is the enemy of discontent and dissatisfaction." -(H.A. Ironside)
"The way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement."( -Charles Schwab)
"No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks".--(Unknown)
"Let us be grateful to people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom."--(Marcel Proust)
"Silent gratitude isn't very much use to anyone." (-Gertrude Stein)
"If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough." -(Meister Eckhart)
"Gratitude is riches. Complaint is poverty." -(Doris Day)
"The world has enough beautiful mountains and meadows, spectacular skies and serene lakes. It has enough lush forests, flowered fields, and sandy beaches. It has plenty of stars and the promise of a new sunrise and sunset every day. What the world needs more of is people to appreciate and enjoy it." -(Michael Josephson)
"Gratitude is a currency that we can mint for ourselves, and spend without fear of bankruptcy." -(Fred De Witt Van Amburgh)
"I may not be where I want to be but I'm thankful for not being where I used to be." (-Habeeb Akande)
"Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend." -(Melody Beattie)
"As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them." (-John F. Kennedy)
"Develop an attitude of gratitude, and give thanks for everything that happens to you, knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation." (-Brian Tracy)
"Gratitude is the most exquisite form of courtesy." -(Jacques Maritain)
"At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lighted the flame within us." (-Albert Schweitzer)
"When a person doesn't have gratitude, something is missing in his or her humanity." (-Elie Wiesel)
"Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance." -(Eckhart Tolle)
"If a fellow isn't thankful for what he's got, he isn't likely to be thankful for what he's going to get." (-Frank A. Clark)
"If you want to turn your life around, try thankfulness. It will change your life mightily." (-Gerald Good)
"Gratitude is a duty which ought to be paid, but which none have a right to expect." -(Jean-Jacques Rousseau)
"Some people are always grumbling because roses have thorns; I am thankful that thorns have roses." -(Alphonse Karr)
"Make it a habit to tell people thank you. To express your appreciation, sincerely and without the expectation of anything in return. Truly appreciate those around you, and you'll soon find many others around you. Truly appreciate life, and you'll find that you have more of it." -(Ralph Marston)
"Appreciation is a wonderful thing: It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well." -(Voltaire)
"When it comes to life the critical thing is whether you take things for granted or take them with gratitude." (-Gilbert K. Chesterton)
"It's a sign of mediocrity when you demonstrate gratitude with moderation." -(Roberto Benigni)
"'Thank you' is the best prayer that anyone could say. I say that one a lot. Thank you expresses extreme gratitude, humility, understanding." (-Alice Walker)
"Be grateful for what you have and stop complaining-it bores everybody else, does you no good, and doesn't solve any problems." -(Zig Ziglar)
"He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has."--(Epictetus)

                            20. Whenever Thanks giving rolls around, I know that it's not always easy to be thankful for what you have. As an entrepreneur, I have to make payroll, meet with prospects, find the time to work on my next book, and try to fit in some time for my wife, daughter, and pets.
Like many of us, I run the risk of getting too wrapped up in what I don't yet have that I might not focus on what I do have. You may know people like me, or even struggle with thankfulness yourself.
With that in mind, I try to step back and look at my favorite quotes about thankfulness to inspire me:
"Feeling gratitu0de and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it." -(William Arthur Ward)
"Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough." (-Oprah Winfrey)
"No one who achieves success does so without acknowledging the help of others. The wise and confident acknowledge this help with gratitude." -(Alfred North Whitehead)
"We would worry less if we praised more. Thanks giving is the enemy of discontent and dissatisfaction." -(H.A. Ironside)
"The way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement."( -Charles Schwab)
"No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks".--(Unknown)
"Let us be grateful to people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom."--(Marcel Proust)
"Silent gratitude isn't very much use to anyone." (-Gertrude Stein)
"If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough." -(Meister Eckhart)
"Gratitude is riches. Complaint is poverty." -(Doris Day)
"The world has enough beautiful mountains and meadows, spectacular skies and serene lakes. It has enough lush forests, flowered fields, and sandy beaches. It has plenty of stars and the promise of a new sunrise and sunset every day. What the world needs more of is people to appreciate and enjoy it." -(Michael Josephson)
"Gratitude is a currency that we can mint for ourselves, and spend without fear of bankruptcy." -(Fred De Witt Van Amburgh)
"I may not be where I want to be but I'm thankful for not being where I used to be." (-Habeeb Akande)
"Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend." -(Melody Beattie)
"As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them." (-John F. Kennedy)
"Develop an attitude of gratitude, and give thanks for everything that happens to you, knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation." (-Brian Tracy)
"Gratitude is the most exquisite form of courtesy." -(Jacques Maritain)
"At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lighted the flame within us." (-Albert Schweitzer)
"When a person doesn't have gratitude, something is missing in his or her humanity." (-Elie Wiesel)
"Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance." -(Eckhart Tolle)
"If a fellow isn't thankful for what he's got, he isn't likely to be thankful for what he's going to get." (-Frank A. Clark)
"If you want to turn your life around, try thankfulness. It will change your life mightily." (-Gerald Good)
"Gratitude is a duty which ought to be paid, but which none have a right to expect." -(Jean-Jacques Rousseau)
"Some people are always grumbling because roses have thorns; I am thankful that thorns have roses." -(Alphonse Karr)
