                                            Body Shaming : Skinny Shaming   
Intro :  “Body shaming,” the act of humiliating someone for their size, can happen to anyone. In our society, to be called "thin" is generally a compliment. To be “fat,” by contrast, means facing a stigma on a daily basis, particularly about one’s health. Hence, when you tell people that they are "too skinny" or to "eat more", even if it's just for fun, that means you are praising them and that they shouldn't feel offended by your words. But is that really a praise ?   
Supporting arguments :   In day-to-day life, thin women state that they're often on the receiving end of comments such as: “just eat the sandwich”; “you’re all skin and bones”; and “do you even eat?”. Someone in a thin body—particularly a woman—may be teased, bullied, or discriminated against for not possessing a certain body type historically associated with femininity and the male gaze. Thin women are disgustingly told that “only dogs want bones,” and that their lack of curves is unattractive. Thin women may also be food policed: chided for their rightful choice to order a salad, or screamed at, even by strangers, to “eat a cheeseburger.” They are assumed to have eating disorders, as if anorexia and bulimia are body types. This treatment is inarguably unacceptable.  
Contrary Arguments :   On the other hand, Sonya Renee Taylor, author of The Body Is Not an Apology explained that "“While someone may tease a thin person, thin people are not disproportionately misdiagnosed as a result of medical fatphobia. Collectively, people are not paid less, hired less, or systemically harmed and discriminated against for being thin.”  For example, designers usually use thin women as models because  the clothes hang off them nicely because they have fewer curves and rolls. Being thin is obviously better than being fat because it has lower risk of developing diabetes, stroke, cancer, or heart disease.   As such, while body shaming absolutely is something that people in thin bodies deal with (and shouldn’t have to), and while the effects of that can be devastating, thin people do not experience weight-based oppression in the same way as fat people.  
Conclusion :  Society seems to think commenting on thin bodies is some sort of compliment. That means telling thin person to "go eat something" is a very acceptable joke while it's not. Commenting on someone's body is never okay because it's harmful to people who are still becoming comfortable in their own skin.   This also means that phrases like, “Real women have curves,” or “She needs to eat a cheeseburger,” need to go in the trash can. The definition of a “real woman” has nothing to do with her size or physical appearance.  Real women know their worth, no matter what size they are. They eat cheeseburgers, they work out, they are naturally slim, they are voluptuous, they are plus-size, and they love themselves. They have integrity, they are strong, they are kind, but most of all, they absolutely never make snide comments about the body type of another woman.

                                            Body Shaming : Skinny Shaming   
Intro :  “Body shaming,” the act of humiliating someone for their size, can happen to anyone. In our society, to be called "thin" is generally a compliment. To be “fat,” by contrast, means facing a stigma on a daily basis, particularly about one’s health. Hence, when you tell people that they are "too skinny" or to "eat more", even if it's just for fun, that means you are praising them and that they shouldn't feel offended by your words. But is that really a praise ?  
 Supporting arguments :   In day-to-day life, thin women state that they're often on the receiving end of comments such as: “just eat the sandwich”; “you’re all skin and bones”; and “do you even eat?”. Someone in a thin body—particularly a woman—may be teased, bullied, or discriminated against for not possessing a certain body type historically associated with femininity and the male gaze. Thin women are disgustingly told that “only dogs want bones,” and that their lack of curves is unattractive. Thin women may also be food policed: chided for their rightful choice to order a salad, or screamed at, even by strangers, to “eat a cheeseburger.” They are assumed to have eating disorders, as if anorexia and bulimia are body types. This treatment is inarguably unacceptable.  
Contrary Arguments :   On the other hand, Sonya Renee Taylor, author of The Body Is Not an Apology explained that "“While someone may tease a thin person, thin people are not disproportionately misdiagnosed as a result of medical fatphobia. Collectively, people are not paid less, hired less, or systemically harmed and discriminated against for being thin.”  For example, designers usually use thin women as models because  the clothes hang off them nicely because they have fewer curves and rolls. Being thin is obviously better than being fat because it has lower risk of developing diabetes, stroke, cancer, or heart disease.   As such, while body shaming absolutely is something that people in thin bodies deal with (and shouldn’t have to), and while the effects of that can be devastating, thin people do not experience weight-based oppression in the same way as fat people.  
Conclusion :  Society seems to think commenting on thin bodies is some sort of compliment. That means telling thin person to "go eat something" is a very acceptable joke while it's not. Commenting on someone's body is never okay because it's harmful to people who are still becoming comfortable in their own skin.   This also means that phrases like, “Real women have curves,” or “She needs to eat a cheeseburger,” need to go in the trash can. The definition of a “real woman” has nothing to do with her size or physical appearance.  Real women know their worth, no matter what size they are. They eat cheeseburgers, they work out, they are naturally slim, they are voluptuous, they are plus-size, and they love themselves. They have integrity, they are strong, they are kind, but most of all, they absolutely never make snide comments about the body type of another woman.

                                            ASAL MULA KAMPUNG GEDONGKampung Gedong adalah nama sebuah kelurahan di Kecamatan Pasar Rebo, Jakarta Timur. Wilayahnya dibatasi oleh Condet Balekambang, Condet Batuampar dan Kampung Tengah, Kecamatan Kramatjati di sebelah utara, Pejaten Timur dan Tanjung Barat di sebelah Barat, Kelurahan Rambutan di sebelah Timur dan Cijantung di sebelah Selatan.Sebelum era perang kemerdekaan Kampung Gedong masuk ke dalam wilayah partikulir Condet Balekambang, sebuah kampung yang merupakan bentukan pada masa penjajahan Jepang yang dimulai pada 1942.Di kampung ini terdapat sebuah bangunan besar peninggalan Belanda. Masyarakat setempat setempat menyebutnya gedong, sebuah landhuis atau rumah tuan tanah sisa peninggalan zaman particuliere landerijen, tanah partikelir perkebunan swasta di Tandjong Oost atau Tanjung Timur.Nama sebutan Tandjong Oost itu bermula di masa pemerintahan Gubernur Jenderal baron Van Imhoff. Ia secara perlahan-lahan memulai memberi nama perkebunan di selatan Meester Cornelis sepanjang Ciliwung berdasar pembagian wilayah barat dan timur sisi Sungai Ciliwung, seperti Tjibinong West dan Tjibinong Oost maupun Tandjong West dan Tandjong Oost.Lokasi tepatnya landhuis Tanjong Oost itu di Kampung Gedong, Pasar Rebo, berdiri di atas lahan yang dulu disebut Tandjong Oost atau Tanjung Timur. Jika dari arah perapatan Pasar Rebo menuju arah Tanjung Barat sebelum jembatan, posisinya di sebelah kiri tertutup oleh bangunan perumahan kepolisian.Dari gedung landhuis itu sampai tempat yang sekarang menjadi perempatan Pasar Rebo, Jalan Raya Bogor, terbentang jalan yang dahulu kanan kirinya ditanam pohon asem (Tamarindus indica), menambah keasrian pemandangan sekitarnya.Dari landhuis atau rumah tuan tanah yang ada di daerah Kramatjati dan sekitarnya mungkin hanya Landhuis ini yang memiliki banyak penamaan, mulai dari Rumah Pangeran Papak, Landhuis Tandjong Oost, Landhuis Groeneveld, Gedong Tinggi, Gedong Kongsi, dan Gedong Ki Dekle’. Semua penamaan itu masih terekam kuat dalam ingatan masyarakat, terutama nama Gedong (Gedong Tinggi dan  Gedong Kongsi) dan Ki Dekle.Lahan dan landhuis Tandjong Oost selama berdiri tercatat telah dimiliki atau dikelola sedikitnya oleh tujuh belas pemilik, antara lain dua belas dikelola oleh orang atau intansi Belanda, yaitu Pieter Van Den Velde (1714-1759), Adriaan Jubbels (1700-1763), Jacobus Johannes Craan (1728-1780), Catharina Johanna Margaritha Craan (1754-1792) dan Willem Vincent Helvetius Van Riemsdijk (1752-1818), Daniel Cornelius Helvetius Van Riemsdijk (1783-1860), Dina Cornelia Helvetius Van Riemsdijk (1807-1877), Michiel Ament (1721-1806), Daniel Cornelis Ament (1827-1903), Eduard Corneille Collet Ament (1856-1935), Daniel Cornelis Ament (1886-1936), Sonia Renee Ament (1891-1951).Lantas pada masa Jepang dikuasai GUNSEIKANBU atau Pemerintahan Militer Jepang (1942-1945) dan kemudian setelah itu jatuh ke tangan Tentara Keamanan Rakyat (1945-1948). Kemudian pada masa revolusi diambil alih Nederland Indische Civil Administratie atau NICA (1948-1950).Sekembali ibukota dari Yogyakarta landhuis Tanjong Oost dikuasai H. Sarmili (1950-1962). Pada masa Demokrasi Terpimpin diambil alih POLRI (1962-1985). Sampai akhirnya setelah kebakaran besar pada 1985 yang menghanguskan sebagian besar bangunannya diserahkan kepada Pemerintah DKI JAKARTA.Gedong dengan arsitektur yang begitu indah yang dulu dimiliki oleh beberapa keluarga Eropa terkemuka itu kini hanya tinggal puing-puingnya saja, berada di dalam satu wilayah dengan perumahan Ksatrian Polri.Tuliskan ringkasan dari wacana diatas!#pliss Kak..​</a>

                                            Body Shaming : Skinny Shaming   
Intro :  “Body shaming,” the act of humiliating someone for their size, can happen to anyone. In our society, to be called "thin" is generally a compliment. To be “fat,” by contrast, means facing a stigma on a daily basis, particularly about one’s health. Hence, when you tell people that they are "too skinny" or to "eat more", even if it's just for fun, that means you are praising them and that they shouldn't feel offended by your words. But is that really a praise ?   
Supporting arguments :   In day-to-day life, thin women state that they're often on the receiving end of comments such as: “just eat the sandwich”; “you’re all skin and bones”; and “do you even eat?”. Someone in a thin body—particularly a woman—may be teased, bullied, or discriminated against for not possessing a certain body type historically associated with femininity and the male gaze. Thin women are disgustingly told that “only dogs want bones,” and that their lack of curves is unattractive. Thin women may also be food policed: chided for their rightful choice to order a salad, or screamed at, even by strangers, to “eat a cheeseburger.” They are assumed to have eating disorders, as if anorexia and bulimia are body types. This treatment is inarguably unacceptable.  
Contrary Arguments :   On the other hand, Sonya Renee Taylor, author of The Body Is Not an Apology explained that "“While someone may tease a thin person, thin people are not disproportionately misdiagnosed as a result of medical fatphobia. Collectively, people are not paid less, hired less, or systemically harmed and discriminated against for being thin.”  For example, designers usually use thin women as models because  the clothes hang off them nicely because they have fewer curves and rolls. Being thin is obviously better than being fat because it has lower risk of developing diabetes, stroke, cancer, or heart disease.   As such, while body shaming absolutely is something that people in thin bodies deal with (and shouldn’t have to), and while the effects of that can be devastating, thin people do not experience weight-based oppression in the same way as fat people.  
Conclusion :  Society seems to think commenting on thin bodies is some sort of compliment. That means telling thin person to "go eat something" is a very acceptable joke while it's not. Commenting on someone's body is never okay because it's harmful to people who are still becoming comfortable in their own skin.   This also means that phrases like, “Real women have curves,” or “She needs to eat a cheeseburger,” need to go in the trash can. The definition of a “real woman” has nothing to do with her size or physical appearance.  Real women know their worth, no matter what size they are. They eat cheeseburgers, they work out, they are naturally slim, they are voluptuous, they are plus-size, and they love themselves. They have integrity, they are strong, they are kind, but most of all, they absolutely never make snide comments about the body type of another woman.

                        <p>During my last holiday, I made a lot of handcrafts. At that time, I was crazy about art and creativity. Many ideas had come to my mind three months before. All of the ideas were written on my note book so I could read them again. Also, I searched other ideas from internet. Yap, I googled it. I watched tutorial videos and read many art blogs.</p><p>My parents helped me to prepare the materials. They also gave me money to buy things I needed. On the first day, I painted on some rocks. People call it rock art. It was so fun. My siblings joined me on the third day. Then, my siblings and I made paper crafts from used newspapers and magazines. Papers were rolled, shaped and glued together to create decorative designs. Many beautiful crafts were created.</p><br /><p>The last activity was sewing. My mother is a tailor so I learn how to sew from her. My mother helped me too. Sewing used clothes and towels was very fun. We produced many useful things. Finally, I really enjoyed my last holiday.</p><br /><p>Terjemahan:</p><p>Selama liburan yang lalu, saya membuat banyak kerajinan tangan. Saat itu, saya tergila-gila dengan seni dan kreativitas. Banyak ide muncul di benak saya tiga bulan sebelumnya. Semua ide itu ditulis dalam buku catatan sehingga saya bisa membacanya lagi. Selain itu, saya mencari ide lain dari internet. Yap, saya menggunakan google. Saya menonton video tutorial dan membaca banyak blog tentang seni.</p><br /><p>Ayah-ibu membantu saya menyiapkan materi. Mereka juga memberi saya uang untuk membeli barang-barang yang saya butuhkan. Pada hari pertama, saya melukis pada beberapa batu. Orang menyebutnya seni batu. Kegiatan itu sangat menyenangkan. Saudara-saudara saya bergabung pada hari ketiga. Kemudian, kami membuat kerajinan kertas dari koran bekas dan majalah. Kertas-kertas itu digulung, dibentuk dan direkatkan untuk membuat desain yang cantik. Banyak kerajinan indah diciptakan.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><p>Kegiatan terakhir adalah menjahit. Ibu saya adalah penjahit jadi saya belajar menjahit darinya. Ibu juga membantu saya. Menjahit pakaian bekas dan handuk sangat menyenangkan. Kami menghasilkan banyak barang bermanfaat. Akhirnya, saya sangat menikmati liburan lalu.</p><br />

They have integrity, they are strong, they are kind, but most of all, they absolutely never make snide comments about the body type of another woman.

                            11. Body Shaming : Skinny Shaming   
Intro :  “Body shaming,” the act of humiliating someone for their size, can happen to anyone. In our society, to be called "thin" is generally a compliment. To be “fat,” by contrast, means facing a stigma on a daily basis, particularly about one’s health. Hence, when you tell people that they are "too skinny" or to "eat more", even if it's just for fun, that means you are praising them and that they shouldn't feel offended by your words. But is that really a praise ?   
Supporting arguments :   In day-to-day life, thin women state that they're often on the receiving end of comments such as: “just eat the sandwich”; “you’re all skin and bones”; and “do you even eat?”. Someone in a thin body—particularly a woman—may be teased, bullied, or discriminated against for not possessing a certain body type historically associated with femininity and the male gaze. Thin women are disgustingly told that “only dogs want bones,” and that their lack of curves is unattractive. Thin women may also be food policed: chided for their rightful choice to order a salad, or screamed at, even by strangers, to “eat a cheeseburger.” They are assumed to have eating disorders, as if anorexia and bulimia are body types. This treatment is inarguably unacceptable.  
Contrary Arguments :   On the other hand, Sonya Renee Taylor, author of The Body Is Not an Apology explained that "“While someone may tease a thin person, thin people are not disproportionately misdiagnosed as a result of medical fatphobia. Collectively, people are not paid less, hired less, or systemically harmed and discriminated against for being thin.”  For example, designers usually use thin women as models because  the clothes hang off them nicely because they have fewer curves and rolls. Being thin is obviously better than being fat because it has lower risk of developing diabetes, stroke, cancer, or heart disease.   As such, while body shaming absolutely is something that people in thin bodies deal with (and shouldn’t have to), and while the effects of that can be devastating, thin people do not experience weight-based oppression in the same way as fat people.  
Conclusion :  Society seems to think commenting on thin bodies is some sort of compliment. That means telling thin person to "go eat something" is a very acceptable joke while it's not. Commenting on someone's body is never okay because it's harmful to people who are still becoming comfortable in their own skin.   This also means that phrases like, “Real women have curves,” or “She needs to eat a cheeseburger,” need to go in the trash can. The definition of a “real woman” has nothing to do with her size or physical appearance.  Real women know their worth, no matter what size they are. They eat cheeseburgers, they work out, they are naturally slim, they are voluptuous, they are plus-size, and they love themselves. They have integrity, they are strong, they are kind, but most of all, they absolutely never make snide comments about the body type of another woman.

                            14. Body Shaming : Skinny Shaming Intro : “Body shaming,” the act of humiliating someone for their size, can happen to anyone. In our society, to be called "thin" is generally a compliment. To be “fat,” by contrast, means facing a stigma on a daily basis, particularly about one’s health.

                            15. ASAL MULA KAMPUNG GEDONGKampung Gedong adalah nama sebuah kelurahan di Kecamatan Pasar Rebo, Jakarta Timur. Wilayahnya dibatasi oleh Condet Balekambang, Condet Batuampar dan Kampung Tengah, Kecamatan Kramatjati di sebelah utara, Pejaten Timur dan Tanjung Barat di sebelah Barat, Kelurahan Rambutan di sebelah Timur dan Cijantung di sebelah Selatan.Sebelum era perang kemerdekaan Kampung Gedong masuk ke dalam wilayah partikulir Condet Balekambang, sebuah kampung yang merupakan bentukan pada masa penjajahan Jepang yang dimulai pada 1942.Di kampung ini terdapat sebuah bangunan besar peninggalan Belanda. Masyarakat setempat setempat menyebutnya gedong, sebuah landhuis atau rumah tuan tanah sisa peninggalan zaman particuliere landerijen, tanah partikelir perkebunan swasta di Tandjong Oost atau Tanjung Timur.Nama sebutan Tandjong Oost itu bermula di masa pemerintahan Gubernur Jenderal baron Van Imhoff. Ia secara perlahan-lahan memulai memberi nama perkebunan di selatan Meester Cornelis sepanjang Ciliwung berdasar pembagian wilayah barat dan timur sisi Sungai Ciliwung, seperti Tjibinong West dan Tjibinong Oost maupun Tandjong West dan Tandjong Oost.Lokasi tepatnya landhuis Tanjong Oost itu di Kampung Gedong, Pasar Rebo, berdiri di atas lahan yang dulu disebut Tandjong Oost atau Tanjung Timur. Jika dari arah perapatan Pasar Rebo menuju arah Tanjung Barat sebelum jembatan, posisinya di sebelah kiri tertutup oleh bangunan perumahan kepolisian.Dari gedung landhuis itu sampai tempat yang sekarang menjadi perempatan Pasar Rebo, Jalan Raya Bogor, terbentang jalan yang dahulu kanan kirinya ditanam pohon asem (Tamarindus indica), menambah keasrian pemandangan sekitarnya.Dari landhuis atau rumah tuan tanah yang ada di daerah Kramatjati dan sekitarnya mungkin hanya Landhuis ini yang memiliki banyak penamaan, mulai dari Rumah Pangeran Papak, Landhuis Tandjong Oost, Landhuis Groeneveld, Gedong Tinggi, Gedong Kongsi, dan Gedong Ki Dekle’. Semua penamaan itu masih terekam kuat dalam ingatan masyarakat, terutama nama Gedong (Gedong Tinggi dan  Gedong Kongsi) dan Ki Dekle.Lahan dan landhuis Tandjong Oost selama berdiri tercatat telah dimiliki atau dikelola sedikitnya oleh tujuh belas pemilik, antara lain dua belas dikelola oleh orang atau intansi Belanda, yaitu Pieter Van Den Velde (1714-1759), Adriaan Jubbels (1700-1763), Jacobus Johannes Craan (1728-1780), Catharina Johanna Margaritha Craan (1754-1792) dan Willem Vincent Helvetius Van Riemsdijk (1752-1818), Daniel Cornelius Helvetius Van Riemsdijk (1783-1860), Dina Cornelia Helvetius Van Riemsdijk (1807-1877), Michiel Ament (1721-1806), Daniel Cornelis Ament (1827-1903), Eduard Corneille Collet Ament (1856-1935), Daniel Cornelis Ament (1886-1936), Sonia Renee Ament (1891-1951).Lantas pada masa Jepang dikuasai GUNSEIKANBU atau Pemerintahan Militer Jepang (1942-1945) dan kemudian setelah itu jatuh ke tangan Tentara Keamanan Rakyat (1945-1948). Kemudian pada masa revolusi diambil alih Nederland Indische Civil Administratie atau NICA (1948-1950).Sekembali ibukota dari Yogyakarta landhuis Tanjong Oost dikuasai H. Sarmili (1950-1962). Pada masa Demokrasi Terpimpin diambil alih POLRI (1962-1985). Sampai akhirnya setelah kebakaran besar pada 1985 yang menghanguskan sebagian besar bangunannya diserahkan kepada Pemerintah DKI JAKARTA.Gedong dengan arsitektur yang begitu indah yang dulu dimiliki oleh beberapa keluarga Eropa terkemuka itu kini hanya tinggal puing-puingnya saja, berada di dalam satu wilayah dengan perumahan Ksatrian Polri.Tuliskan ringkasan dari wacana diatas!#pliss Kak..​</h2><br />

                            18. Body Shaming : Skinny Shaming   
Intro :  “Body shaming,” the act of humiliating someone for their size, can happen to anyone. In our society, to be called "thin" is generally a compliment. To be “fat,” by contrast, means facing a stigma on a daily basis, particularly about one’s health. Hence, when you tell people that they are "too skinny" or to "eat more", even if it's just for fun, that means you are praising them and that they shouldn't feel offended by your words. But is that really a praise ?   
Supporting arguments :   In day-to-day life, thin women state that they're often on the receiving end of comments such as: “just eat the sandwich”; “you’re all skin and bones”; and “do you even eat?”. Someone in a thin body—particularly a woman—may be teased, bullied, or discriminated against for not possessing a certain body type historically associated with femininity and the male gaze. Thin women are disgustingly told that “only dogs want bones,” and that their lack of curves is unattractive. Thin women may also be food policed: chided for their rightful choice to order a salad, or screamed at, even by strangers, to “eat a cheeseburger.” They are assumed to have eating disorders, as if anorexia and bulimia are body types. This treatment is inarguably unacceptable.  
Contrary Arguments :   On the other hand, Sonya Renee Taylor, author of The Body Is Not an Apology explained that "“While someone may tease a thin person, thin people are not disproportionately misdiagnosed as a result of medical fatphobia. Collectively, people are not paid less, hired less, or systemically harmed and discriminated against for being thin.”  For example, designers usually use thin women as models because  the clothes hang off them nicely because they have fewer curves and rolls. Being thin is obviously better than being fat because it has lower risk of developing diabetes, stroke, cancer, or heart disease.   As such, while body shaming absolutely is something that people in thin bodies deal with (and shouldn’t have to), and while the effects of that can be devastating, thin people do not experience weight-based oppression in the same way as fat people.  
Conclusion :  Society seems to think commenting on thin bodies is some sort of compliment. That means telling thin person to "go eat something" is a very acceptable joke while it's not. Commenting on someone's body is never okay because it's harmful to people who are still becoming comfortable in their own skin.   This also means that phrases like, “Real women have curves,” or “She needs to eat a cheeseburger,” need to go in the trash can. The definition of a “real woman” has nothing to do with her size or physical appearance.  Real women know their worth, no matter what size they are. They eat cheeseburgers, they work out, they are naturally slim, they are voluptuous, they are plus-size, and they love themselves. They have integrity, they are strong, they are kind, but most of all, they absolutely never make snide comments about the body type of another woman.
