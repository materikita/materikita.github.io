                                            4. Dolphins also display culture, something long believed to be unique to humans. I May 2005, a discovery in Australia found Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) teaching their young to use tools. They cover their snouts with sponges to protect them while foraging (looking or searching for food or provisions.) Using sponges as mouth protection as well as other transmitted behavior proves dolphins' intelligence. This knowledge is mostly transferred by mothers to daughters. a.

His future plans Seventeen-year-old sailor realizes dream O n July 16, 2009, when Zac Sunderland sailed back into Marina del Rey Harbor in Los Angeles, California, he was welcomed as the youngest person to ever sail solo around the world. Zac, who was 17 years of age at the time, spent 13 months and two days alone at sea. sea. This was not the first time Zac had spent long periods at (1.) As a child, his family sailed to Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Mexico. In Mexico, his father, shipwright and yachtsman Laurence Sunderland, bought a 16 meter (51 feet) Aleutian sailboat that he and young Zac fixed up to make suitable for family life. The Sunderland family then spent three years on the boat cruising around California's Channel Islands, the Baja peninsula, and mainland Mexico. His time sailing and an encounter with a book about a trip around the world gave him his dream: to sail solo around the world, and Zac was convinced he would achieve it if he really focused on it. When he turned 16, Zac began to train himself both mentally and physically by racing, navigating, and repairing yachts. (2.) Finally, he was able to purchase a 12 meter (36 feet) yacht that he and his father prepared for the solo voyage. He christened the yacht The Intrepid. He chose the name because he felt that in order to make the journey, he needed a boat that was "resolutely fearless, dauntless, brave, courageous, and bold" to carry him around the world. His voyage would be even harder because Zac planned to continue his education on the boat. Before setting sail, Zac reported that he had all his school books with him and that he would send his assignments by email home to his mother for grading. (3.) If his mother helped him study, he was sure he would do well. He departed from Marina del Rey on June 14, 2008 to make his way around the globe. He initially planned to make about 30 stops along his journey, beginning with Micronesia. (4.) He changed course and set sail for Oahu, Hawaii where he could stock up on provisions and do some surfing. Although he was the only person aboard his boat, Zac was not completely alone. In addition to having the best safety and communication equipment with him in case something went wrong, he also stayed in touch with family, friends, and the world at large through his blog. Zac documented his CLEM experiences with a video camera. At times he felt scared: "If I live to see this thing through, everything will go well," he said to a video camera he used to record his personal diary during the journey. Before returning to California, Zac's eventual route contained 20 stops, which included places such as The Marshall Islands, Australia, Mauritius, South Africa, Panama, and Mexico. (5.) One of the high points of his journey was when he met the President of the Marshall Islands, Litokwa Tomeing, who personally welcomed him to the island of Majuro. Low points included being chased by pirates off the coast of Indonesia, and having his boat badly damaged in a huge storm at sea. However, he said the biggest obstacle to overcome had been sleep deprivation, and the hardest part of the journey may have been in the days just after launching 13 months before. But he was never discouraged enough to quit. You will not find his name among a list of World Record holders, though. In a somewhat controversial move, the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC), the world sailing authority, refused to grant him the record as the youngest sailor to circumnavigate the globe solo. The WSSRC stated that although Zac Sunderland had sailed more than 28,000 miles, he had not sailed along an approved route. If he had only sailed around Cape Horn, his route would have been approved and he would have received the record. Zac is not disheartened. What are his plans now? To finish high school and to compile his writings and videos into a documentary. For Zac, it looks like smooth sailing ahead.​</a>

Question Group C (part of speech)Tentukan dan hitung jumlah jenis kata yg terdapat pada teks di bawahThe Covid-19 virus has spread across the world with alarming speed, infecting millions and causing economic disruption on an unprecedented scale. In this survey, we examine the impact of the outbreak on the Indonesian economy, as well as the government’s response to the public health crisis and its provisions for the emerging economic crisis. Indonesia’s delay in responding to the health crisis while Covid-19 spread in neighbouring countries in January–February 2020 has been costly for the health of the population. The government’s policy responses have so far been aimed at steadying the ship, addressing both the needs of the poor and the potentially poor (vulnerable) groups. At the time of writing, Covid-19 had not been tamed in Indonesia by any means. Hence, its implications for economic growth, jobs and welfare remained uncertain, as policy discussions were all about opening up the economy from virus-imposed restrictions across the country, under what has been termed the ‘new normal’. bantu jawab </a>

                                            WHAT CAN YOU LEARN FROM THE STORY...... THE SPRING BEAUTY  AN OJIBBEWAY LEGEND  BY HENRY R. SCHOOLCRAFT (ADAPTED)  An 
An old man was sitting in his lodge, by the side
of a frozen stream. It was the end of winter, the
air was not so cold, and his fire was nearly out. 
He was old and alone. His locks were white with
age, and he trembled in every joint. Day after
day passed, and he heard nothing but the sound
of the storm sweeping before it the new-fallen
snow.
One day while his fire was dying, a handsome
young man approached and entered the lodge. 
His cheeks were red, his eyes sparkled. He
walked with a quick, light step. His forehead was
bound with a wreath of sweet-grass, and he
carried a bunch of fragrant flowers in his hand.
``Ah, my son,'' said the old man, ``I am happy
to see you. Come in! Tell me your adventures,
and what strange lands you have seen. I will tell
you of my wonderful deeds, and what I can
perform. You shall do the same, and we will amuse
each other.''
The old man then drew from a bag a curiously
wrought pipe. He filled it with mild tobacco, and
handed it to his guest. They each smoked from
the pipe and then began their stories.
``I am Peboan, the Spirit of Winter,'' said the
old man. ``I blow my breath, and the streams
stand still. The water becomes stiff and hard as
clear stone.''
``I am Seegwun, the Spirit of Spring,'' answered
the youth. ``I breathe, and flowers spring up in
the meadows and woods.''
``I shake my locks,'' said the old man, ``and
snow covers the land. The leaves fall from the
trees, and my breath blows them away. The
birds fly to a distant land, and the animals hide
themselves from the cold.''
``I shake my ringlets,'' said the young man,
``and warm showers of soft rain fall upon the
earth. The flowers lift their heads from the
ground, the grass grows thick and green. My
voice recalls the birds, and they come flying
joyfully from the Southland. The warmth of my
breath unbinds the streams, and they sing the
songs of summer. Music fills the groves where-
ever I walk, and all nature rejoices.''
And while they were talking thus a wonderful
change took place. The sun began to rise. A gentle
warmth stole over the place. Peboan, the
Spirit of Winter, became silent. His head drooped,
and the snow outside the lodge melted away. 
Seegwun, the Spirit of Spring, grew more radiant,
and rose joyfully to his feet. The robin and
the bluebird began to sing on the top of the lodge. 
The stream began to murmur at the door, and
the fragrance of opening flowers came softly on
the breeze.
The lodge faded away, and Peboan sank down
and dissolved into tiny streams of water, that
vanished under the brown leaves of the forest. 
Thus the Spirit of Winter departed, and where
he had melted away, there the Indian children
gathered the first blossoms, fragrant and
delicately pink,--the modest Spring Beauty.</a>

                                            Hague Agreement, also called Round Table Conference Agreement, is a treaty ratified in Den Haag, Holland on November 2, 1949, between the Netherlands and Republic of Indonesia. The agreement attempted to bring an end to the Dutch-Indonesian conflict that followed the proclamation of Indonesian independence in 1945. After prolonged disagreement over its provisions, the treaty was revoked in 1956. According to the treaty, the Dutch agreed to transfer, by December 30, 1949, their political sovereignty over the entire territory of the former Dutch East Indies, with the exception of West New Guinea (West Irian), to the Republic of the United States of Indonesia, which was to be a federal government formed oCthe republican state and 15 autonomous states created by the Dutch. This new republic together with the Netherlands established a Netherlands-Indonesian Union, which was intended to work for the common interest. In return for Dutch political concessions, the new republic gave a guarantee to Dutch investors in the region and accepted the debt of 4.3 billion guilders. The status of West New Guinea was to be settled in discussions to take place the following year. In fact, the transfer was done on December 27, 1945. The Hague Agreement apparently benefited the Netherlands and Indonesian nationalists were dissatisfied with certain articles in the agreement, especially those dealing with the nature of the state, the dominant role of the autonomous Dutch states , the debt and West New Guinea problem The dissatisfied nationalists drafted a provisional constitution in 1950 and established Indonesia as a unitary state.

                                            Kesimpulan dari teks berikut ini :
Universitas Terbuka is the only university-based on long-distance open universities which 
has a law study program incorporated in the Faculty of Law Social and Political Sciences 
(FHISIP). Universitas’s Terbuka Law Study Program has a vision and mission to produce 
graduates who have academic competence in the field of Legal Studies and have 
competitiveness in the community by carrying out community service activities integrated 
with education and research. This certainly must be realized by prioritizing the Open and 
Distance Higher Education (PTTJJ) system. Like the law faculties in Indonesia, the law 
study program must have an Online Consultation and Legal Aid Institute (LKOBH) or 
other designations that can be used in the service of lecturers, students or alumni in 
accordance with Law Number 16 of 2011 concerning Legal Aid. The establishment of 
LKOBH at Universitas Terbuka will certainly be adjusted to the distance mechanism in 
reaching out and providing online legal consultation and assistance services for justice 
seekers. The research method used is the research method that will be used in this research 
is normative research which will then be supported with empirical data from field research 
and try to be formulated in a conceptual approach that is adjusted to the norms contained 
in the provisions of existing laws and regulations and legal theories and doctrines that 
have developed in the science of law. Application and introduction of the concept of 
online legal consultation and assistance by an open university will be a service concept 
that will reach the public from various walks of life in Indonesia, assisted by UPBJJ 
centres throughout Indonesia, Universitas Terbuka’s Law Lecturers, Law tutors, lawyers, 
advocates, students and alumni of study programs law in assisting Universitas Terbuka to 
provide free legal aid and consultation services to the community. The expectation given 
in the implementation is not only a means of community service but also a means of 
teaching and research that will develop in line with the real solutions to problems faced 
by the community.</a>

                                            THE SPRING BEAUTY
AN OJIBBEWAY LEGEND
BY HENRY R. SCHOOLCRAFT (ADAPTED)
An old man was sitting in his lodge, by the side
of a frozen stream. It was the end of winter, the
air was not so cold, and his fire was nearly out. 
He was old and alone. His locks were white with
age, and he trembled in every joint. Day after
day passed, and he heard nothing but the sound
of the storm sweeping before it the new-fallen
snow.
One day while his fire was dying, a handsome
young man approached and entered the lodge. 
His cheeks were red, his eyes sparkled. He
walked with a quick, light step. His forehead was
bound with a wreath of sweet-grass, and he
carried a bunch of fragrant flowers in his hand.
``Ah, my son,'' said the old man, ``I am happy
to see you. Come in! Tell me your adventures,
and what strange lands you have seen. I will tell
you of my wonderful deeds, and what I can
perform. You shall do the same, and we will amuse
each other.''
The old man then drew from a bag a curiously
wrought pipe. He filled it with mild tobacco, and
handed it to his guest. They each smoked from
the pipe and then began their stories.
``I am Peboan, the Spirit of Winter,'' said the
old man. ``I blow my breath, and the streams
stand still. The water becomes stiff and hard as
clear stone.''
``I am Seegwun, the Spirit of Spring,'' answered
the youth. ``I breathe, and flowers spring up in
the meadows and woods.''
``I shake my locks,'' said the old man, ``and
snow covers the land. The leaves fall from the
trees, and my breath blows them away. The
birds fly to a distant land, and the animals hide
themselves from the cold.''
``I shake my ringlets,'' said the young man,
``and warm showers of soft rain fall upon the
earth. The flowers lift their heads from the
ground, the grass grows thick and green. My
voice recalls the birds, and they come flying
joyfully from the Southland. The warmth of my
breath unbinds the streams, and they sing the
songs of summer. Music fills the groves where-
ever I walk, and all nature rejoices.''
And while they were talking thus a wonderful
change took place. The sun began to rise. A gentle
warmth stole over the place. Peboan, the
Spirit of Winter, became silent. His head drooped,
and the snow outside the lodge melted away. 
Seegwun, the Spirit of Spring, grew more radiant,
and rose joyfully to his feet. The robin and
the bluebird began to sing on the top of the lodge. 
The stream began to murmur at the door, and
the fragrance of opening flowers came softly on
the breeze.
The lodge faded away, and Peboan sank down
and dissolved into tiny streams of water, that
vanished under the brown leaves of the forest. 
Thus the Spirit of Winter departed, and where
he had melted away, there the Indian children
gathered the first blossoms, fragrant and
delicately pink,--the modest Spring Beauty.

                                            Universitas Terbuka is the only university-based on long-distance open universities which 
has a law study program incorporated in the Faculty of Law Social and Political Sciences 
(FHISIP). Universitas’s Terbuka Law Study Program has a vision and mission to produce 
graduates who have academic competence in the field of Legal Studies and have 
competitiveness in the community by carrying out community service activities integrated 
with education and research. This certainly must be realized by prioritizing the Open and 
Distance Higher Education (PTTJJ) system. Like the law faculties in Indonesia, the law 
study program must have an Online Consultation and Legal Aid Institute (LKOBH) or 
other designations that can be used in the service of lecturers, students or alumni in 
accordance with Law Number 16 of 2011 concerning Legal Aid. The establishment of 
LKOBH at Universitas Terbuka will certainly be adjusted to the distance mechanism in 
reaching out and providing online legal consultation and assistance services for justice 
seekers. The research method used is the research method that will be used in this research 
is normative research which will then be supported with empirical data from field research 
and try to be formulated in a conceptual approach that is adjusted to the norms contained 
in the provisions of existing laws and regulations and legal theories and doctrines that 
have developed in the science of law. Application and introduction of the concept of 
online legal consultation and assistance by an open university will be a service concept 
that will reach the public from various walks of life in Indonesia, assisted by UPBJJ 
centres throughout Indonesia, Universitas Terbuka’s Law Lecturers, Law tutors, lawyers, 
advocates, students and alumni of study programs law in assisting Universitas Terbuka to 
provide free legal aid and consultation services to the community. The expectation given 
in the implementation is not only a means of community service but also a means of 
teaching and research that will develop in line with the real solutions to problems faced 
by the community.</a>

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the
state of Delaware, and various US senators and representatives
have recently proposed substantial regulations
that would limit executive pay, limit a firm’s control of
the proxy process (i.e., proxy access), and ban specific
corporate governance provisions [e.g., staggered boards
and chief executive officer (CEO)-chairman duality].with various measures of shareholder value.2 However,
given the endogenous nature of corporate governance, it
is not surprising that many of the results linking governance
and shareholder value are mixed.3 Because governance
choices are endogenous decisions made by managers
and shareholders, the value-maximizing governance
choices for one firm could be very different from the
value-maximizing governance choices of another firm. As
a result, in equilibrium, the relation between governance
choices and shareholder value is ambiguous.</a>

They cover their snouts with sponges to protect them while foraging (looking or searching for food or provisions.) Using sponges as mouth protection as well as other transmitted behavior proves dolphins' intelligence. This knowledge is mostly transferred by mothers to daughters. a.

His future plans Seventeen-year-old sailor realizes dream O n July 16, 2009, when Zac Sunderland sailed back into Marina del Rey Harbor in Los Angeles, California, he was welcomed as the youngest person to ever sail solo around the world. Zac, who was 17 years of age at the time, spent 13 months and two days alone at sea. sea. This was not the first time Zac had spent long periods at (1.) As a child, his family sailed to Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Mexico. In Mexico, his father, shipwright and yachtsman Laurence Sunderland, bought a 16 meter (51 feet) Aleutian sailboat that he and young Zac fixed up to make suitable for family life. The Sunderland family then spent three years on the boat cruising around California's Channel Islands, the Baja peninsula, and mainland Mexico. His time sailing and an encounter with a book about a trip around the world gave him his dream: to sail solo around the world, and Zac was convinced he would achieve it if he really focused on it. When he turned 16, Zac began to train himself both mentally and physically by racing, navigating, and repairing yachts. (2.) Finally, he was able to purchase a 12 meter (36 feet) yacht that he and his father prepared for the solo voyage. He christened the yacht The Intrepid. He chose the name because he felt that in order to make the journey, he needed a boat that was "resolutely fearless, dauntless, brave, courageous, and bold" to carry him around the world. His voyage would be even harder because Zac planned to continue his education on the boat. Before setting sail, Zac reported that he had all his school books with him and that he would send his assignments by email home to his mother for grading. (3.) If his mother helped him study, he was sure he would do well. He departed from Marina del Rey on June 14, 2008 to make his way around the globe. He initially planned to make about 30 stops along his journey, beginning with Micronesia. (4.) He changed course and set sail for Oahu, Hawaii where he could stock up on provisions and do some surfing. Although he was the only person aboard his boat, Zac was not completely alone. In addition to having the best safety and communication equipment with him in case something went wrong, he also stayed in touch with family, friends, and the world at large through his blog. Zac documented his CLEM experiences with a video camera. At times he felt scared: "If I live to see this thing through, everything will go well," he said to a video camera he used to record his personal diary during the journey. Before returning to California, Zac's eventual route contained 20 stops, which included places such as The Marshall Islands, Australia, Mauritius, South Africa, Panama, and Mexico. (5.) One of the high points of his journey was when he met the President of the Marshall Islands, Litokwa Tomeing, who personally welcomed him to the island of Majuro. Low points included being chased by pirates off the coast of Indonesia, and having his boat badly damaged in a huge storm at sea. However, he said the biggest obstacle to overcome had been sleep deprivation, and the hardest part of the journey may have been in the days just after launching 13 months before. But he was never discouraged enough to quit. You will not find his name among a list of World Record holders, though. In a somewhat controversial move, the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC), the world sailing authority, refused to grant him the record as the youngest sailor to circumnavigate the globe solo. The WSSRC stated that although Zac Sunderland had sailed more than 28,000 miles, he had not sailed along an approved route. If he had only sailed around Cape Horn, his route would have been approved and he would have received the record. Zac is not disheartened. What are his plans now? To finish high school and to compile his writings and videos into a documentary. For Zac, it looks like smooth sailing ahead.​</h2><br />

Question Group C (part of speech)Tentukan dan hitung jumlah jenis kata yg terdapat pada teks di bawahThe Covid-19 virus has spread across the world with alarming speed, infecting millions and causing economic disruption on an unprecedented scale. In this survey, we examine the impact of the outbreak on the Indonesian economy, as well as the government’s response to the public health crisis and its provisions for the emerging economic crisis. Indonesia’s delay in responding to the health crisis while Covid-19 spread in neighbouring countries in January–February 2020 has been costly for the health of the population. The government’s policy responses have so far been aimed at steadying the ship, addressing both the needs of the poor and the potentially poor (vulnerable) groups. At the time of writing, Covid-19 had not been tamed in Indonesia by any means. Hence, its implications for economic growth, jobs and welfare remained uncertain, as policy discussions were all about opening up the economy from virus-imposed restrictions across the country, under what has been termed the ‘new normal’. bantu jawab </h2><br />

                            14. WHAT CAN YOU LEARN FROM THE STORY...... THE SPRING BEAUTY  AN OJIBBEWAY LEGEND  BY HENRY R. SCHOOLCRAFT (ADAPTED)  An 
An old man was sitting in his lodge, by the side
of a frozen stream. It was the end of winter, the
air was not so cold, and his fire was nearly out. 
He was old and alone. His locks were white with
age, and he trembled in every joint. Day after
day passed, and he heard nothing but the sound
of the storm sweeping before it the new-fallen
snow.
One day while his fire was dying, a handsome
young man approached and entered the lodge. 
His cheeks were red, his eyes sparkled. He
walked with a quick, light step. His forehead was
bound with a wreath of sweet-grass, and he
carried a bunch of fragrant flowers in his hand.
``Ah, my son,'' said the old man, ``I am happy
to see you. Come in! Tell me your adventures,
and what strange lands you have seen. I will tell
you of my wonderful deeds, and what I can
perform. You shall do the same, and we will amuse
each other.''
The old man then drew from a bag a curiously
wrought pipe. He filled it with mild tobacco, and
handed it to his guest. They each smoked from
the pipe and then began their stories.
``I am Peboan, the Spirit of Winter,'' said the
old man. ``I blow my breath, and the streams
stand still. The water becomes stiff and hard as
clear stone.''
``I am Seegwun, the Spirit of Spring,'' answered
the youth. ``I breathe, and flowers spring up in
the meadows and woods.''
``I shake my locks,'' said the old man, ``and
snow covers the land. The leaves fall from the
trees, and my breath blows them away. The
birds fly to a distant land, and the animals hide
themselves from the cold.''
``I shake my ringlets,'' said the young man,
``and warm showers of soft rain fall upon the
earth. The flowers lift their heads from the
ground, the grass grows thick and green. My
voice recalls the birds, and they come flying
joyfully from the Southland. The warmth of my
breath unbinds the streams, and they sing the
songs of summer. Music fills the groves where-
ever I walk, and all nature rejoices.''
And while they were talking thus a wonderful
change took place. The sun began to rise. A gentle
warmth stole over the place. Peboan, the
Spirit of Winter, became silent. His head drooped,
and the snow outside the lodge melted away. 
Seegwun, the Spirit of Spring, grew more radiant,
and rose joyfully to his feet. The robin and
the bluebird began to sing on the top of the lodge. 
The stream began to murmur at the door, and
the fragrance of opening flowers came softly on
the breeze.
The lodge faded away, and Peboan sank down
and dissolved into tiny streams of water, that
vanished under the brown leaves of the forest. 
Thus the Spirit of Winter departed, and where
he had melted away, there the Indian children
gathered the first blossoms, fragrant and
delicately pink,--the modest Spring Beauty.</h2><br />

Hague Agreement, also called Round Table Conference Agreement, is a treaty ratified in Den Haag, Holland on November 2, 1949, between the Netherlands and Republic of Indonesia. The agreement attempted to bring an end to the Dutch-Indonesian conflict that followed the proclamation of Indonesian independence in 1945. After prolonged disagreement over its provisions, the treaty was revoked in 1956. According to the treaty, the Dutch agreed to transfer, by December 30, 1949, their political sovereignty over the entire territory of the former Dutch East Indies, with the exception of West New Guinea (West Irian), to the Republic of the United States of Indonesia, which was to be a federal government formed oCthe republican state and 15 autonomous states created by the Dutch. This new republic together with the Netherlands established a Netherlands-Indonesian Union, which was intended to work for the common interest. In return for Dutch political concessions, the new republic gave a guarantee to Dutch investors in the region and accepted the debt of 4.3 billion guilders. The status of West New Guinea was to be settled in discussions to take place the following year. In fact, the transfer was done on December 27, 1945.

Universitas Terbuka is the only university-based on long-distance open universities which 
has a law study program incorporated in the Faculty of Law Social and Political Sciences 
(FHISIP). Universitas’s Terbuka Law Study Program has a vision and mission to produce 
graduates who have academic competence in the field of Legal Studies and have 
competitiveness in the community by carrying out community service activities integrated 
with education and research. This certainly must be realized by prioritizing the Open and 
Distance Higher Education (PTTJJ) system. Like the law faculties in Indonesia, the law 
study program must have an Online Consultation and Legal Aid Institute (LKOBH) or 
other designations that can be used in the service of lecturers, students or alumni in 
accordance with Law Number 16 of 2011 concerning Legal Aid. The establishment of 
LKOBH at Universitas Terbuka will certainly be adjusted to the distance mechanism in 
reaching out and providing online legal consultation and assistance services for justice 
seekers. The research method used is the research method that will be used in this research 
is normative research which will then be supported with empirical data from field research 
and try to be formulated in a conceptual approach that is adjusted to the norms contained 
in the provisions of existing laws and regulations and legal theories and doctrines that 
have developed in the science of law. Application and introduction of the concept of 
online legal consultation and assistance by an open university will be a service concept 
that will reach the public from various walks of life in Indonesia, assisted by UPBJJ 
centres throughout Indonesia, Universitas Terbuka’s Law Lecturers, Law tutors, lawyers, 
advocates, students and alumni of study programs law in assisting Universitas Terbuka to 
provide free legal aid and consultation services to the community. The expectation given 
in the implementation is not only a means of community service but also a means of 
teaching and research that will develop in line with the real solutions to problems faced 
by the community.</h2><br />

                            25. THE SPRING BEAUTY
AN OJIBBEWAY LEGEND
BY HENRY R. SCHOOLCRAFT (ADAPTED)
An old man was sitting in his lodge, by the side
of a frozen stream. It was the end of winter, the
air was not so cold, and his fire was nearly out. 
He was old and alone. His locks were white with
age, and he trembled in every joint. Day after
day passed, and he heard nothing but the sound
of the storm sweeping before it the new-fallen
snow.
One day while his fire was dying, a handsome
young man approached and entered the lodge. 
His cheeks were red, his eyes sparkled. He
walked with a quick, light step. His forehead was
bound with a wreath of sweet-grass, and he
carried a bunch of fragrant flowers in his hand.
``Ah, my son,'' said the old man, ``I am happy
to see you. Come in! Tell me your adventures,
and what strange lands you have seen. I will tell
you of my wonderful deeds, and what I can
perform. You shall do the same, and we will amuse
each other.''
The old man then drew from a bag a curiously
wrought pipe. He filled it with mild tobacco, and
handed it to his guest. They each smoked from
the pipe and then began their stories.
``I am Peboan, the Spirit of Winter,'' said the
old man. ``I blow my breath, and the streams
stand still. The water becomes stiff and hard as
clear stone.''
``I am Seegwun, the Spirit of Spring,'' answered
the youth. ``I breathe, and flowers spring up in
the meadows and woods.''
``I shake my locks,'' said the old man, ``and
snow covers the land. The leaves fall from the
trees, and my breath blows them away. The
birds fly to a distant land, and the animals hide
themselves from the cold.''
``I shake my ringlets,'' said the young man,
``and warm showers of soft rain fall upon the
earth. The flowers lift their heads from the
ground, the grass grows thick and green. My
voice recalls the birds, and they come flying
joyfully from the Southland. The warmth of my
breath unbinds the streams, and they sing the
songs of summer. Music fills the groves where-
ever I walk, and all nature rejoices.''
And while they were talking thus a wonderful
change took place. The sun began to rise. A gentle
warmth stole over the place. Peboan, the
Spirit of Winter, became silent. His head drooped,
and the snow outside the lodge melted away. 
Seegwun, the Spirit of Spring, grew more radiant,
and rose joyfully to his feet. The robin and
the bluebird began to sing on the top of the lodge. 
The stream began to murmur at the door, and
the fragrance of opening flowers came softly on
the breeze.
The lodge faded away, and Peboan sank down
and dissolved into tiny streams of water, that
vanished under the brown leaves of the forest. 
Thus the Spirit of Winter departed, and where
he had melted away, there the Indian children
gathered the first blossoms, fragrant and
delicately pink,--the modest Spring Beauty.
Questions :
1. When did the story take place?
2. What was the old man, actually?
3. What did he hear for day after day?
4. Who actually came to the old man's lodge and talked with the man?
5. What did the young man look like?
6. What were both of them doing?
7. What would happen to plants when the young man appreared?
8. What happenned to the old man when the sun began to shine?
9. "My voice recalls the birds and they fly in joyfully from the southland." (paragraph 8)
What does the word 'my' refer to?
10. What can you learn from the story?</h2><br />

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the
state of Delaware, and various US senators and representatives
have recently proposed substantial regulations
that would limit executive pay, limit a firm’s control of
the proxy process (i.e., proxy access), and ban specific
corporate governance provisions [e.g., staggered boards
and chief executive officer (CEO)-chairman duality].with various measures of shareholder value.2 However,
given the endogenous nature of corporate governance, it
is not surprising that many of the results linking governance
and shareholder value are mixed.3 Because governance
choices are endogenous decisions made by managers
and shareholders, the value-maximizing governance
choices for one firm could be very different from the
value-maximizing governance choices of another firm. As
a result, in equilibrium, the relation between governance
choices and shareholder value is ambiguous.</h2><br />
                        negara bagian Delaware, dan berbagai senator AS dan perwakilan baru-baru ini mengusulkan peraturan substansial yang akan membatasi gaji eksekutif, membatasi kontrol perusahaan dari proses proxy (i e., akses proxy), dan melarang ketentuan tata kelola perusahaan tertentu Le.g., terhuyung papan dan chief executive officer (CEO) - ketua duality.with berbagai langkah dari pemegang saham value.2 Namun, mengingat sifat endogen tata kelola perusahaan, tidak mengherankan bahwa banyak dari hasil menghubungkan pemerintahan dan nilai pemegang saham yang mixed.3 Karena tata kelola Pilihannya adalah keputusan endogen yang dibuat oleh manajer dan pemegang saham, pilihan tata nilai-memaksimalkan untuk satu perusahaan bisa sangat berbeda dari pilihan tata nilai-memaksimalkan dari perusahaan lain. Akibatnya, dalam kesetimbangan, hubungan antara pilihan governance dan nilai pemegang saham adalah ambigu.<br />
