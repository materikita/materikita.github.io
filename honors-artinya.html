I think this is actually an issue with the world honors being a bit glitchy right after a new day starts and and especially if the server is restarted like it just was. If every world is tied during a new day with zero activity it's sort of random luck who is in the top 1000 until a bit later in the day when things settle down with more accurate visit data. </a>

                                            Some people were executed in Indonesia through July 2016. Most death penalty cases involve the execution of drug peddlers although capital punishment can also be applied for treason, espionage, and other crimes. Many for and against reactions came after the execution. Then, should the death penalty be allowed in Indonesia?Proponents of the death penalty say that it is an important tool for law enforcement, deters crime, and costs less than life imprisonment. They also argue that retribution or "an eye for an eye" honors the victim, helps console grieving families, and ensures that the perpetrators of heinous crimes never have an opportunity to cause future tragedy. Opponents of capital punishment say that it has no deterrent effect on crime, gives governments’ overlapped power to take human life, and potentially makes social injustices by disproportionately targeting people of color (racist) and people who cannot afford good attorneys (classist). They say lifetime jail sentences are a more appropriate than death. In conclusion, death penalty will always exist in our society as well as its pros and cons. For the proponents of this action, they think that it will be very effective to deter crime. While for those who are against this policy, they argue that this punishment will potentially make social injustice.tolong cariin tenses ya dong</a>

                                            TEXT 1 for number 1-5 Military awards have long been considered symbolic of royalty, and thus when the United States was a young nation just finished with revolution and eager to distance itself from anything tasting of monarchy, there was strong sentiment against military decoration. For a century, from the end of the revolutionary War until the Civil War, the United Sates awarded no military honors. The institution of the Meal of Honor in 1861 was a source of great discussion and concern. from the Civil War until World War I, the Medal of Honor was the only military award given by the United States Government, and today it is awarded only in the most extreme cases of heroism. Although the United States us still somewhat wary of granting military awards, several awards have been instituted since World War I. 1. Explain the author's purpose in this passage! 2.

                                            Two types of trees from the same family of trees share honors in certain respects as the most impressive of trees. Both evergreen conifers, the California redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and the giant sequoia (Sequoiandendron giganteum) are found growing natively only in the state of California. The California redwood is found along the northern coast of the state, while the giant sequoia is found inland and at higher elevations, along the western slopes of the Sierra Nevadas.The California redwood is the tallest living tree and is in fact the tallest living thing on the face of the earth; the height of the tallest redwood on record is 385 feet (120 meters), the giant sequoia is nonetheless the largest and most massive of living things; giant sequoias have been measured at more than 100 feet (30 meters) around the base, with weights of more than 6,000 tons.[Phillips, D.

                            11. Some people were executed in Indonesia through July 2016. Most death penalty cases involve the execution of drug peddlers although capital punishment can also be applied for treason, espionage, and other crimes. Many for and against reactions came after the execution. Then, should the death penalty be allowed in Indonesia?Proponents of the death penalty say that it is an important tool for law enforcement, deters crime, and costs less than life imprisonment. They also argue that retribution or "an eye for an eye" honors the victim, helps console grieving families, and ensures that the perpetrators of heinous crimes never have an opportunity to cause future tragedy. Opponents of capital punishment say that it has no deterrent effect on crime, gives governments’ overlapped power to take human life, and potentially makes social injustices by disproportionately targeting people of color (racist) and people who cannot afford good attorneys (classist). They say lifetime jail sentences are a more appropriate than death. In conclusion, death penalty will always exist in our society as well as its pros and cons. For the proponents of this action, they think that it will be very effective to deter crime. While for those who are against this policy, they argue that this punishment will potentially make social injustice.tolong cariin tenses ya dong</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p></p><p>This is an example of <strong>internal conflict</strong>. Internal conflict refers to the struggles and challenges that a character faces within themselves, such as personal doubts, fears, or insecurities. In this case, Wainani is struggling with feelings of inadequacy and insecurity compared to her older sister. These feelings are causing her to doubt herself and her abilities, and she must overcome them in order to win the contest. Internal conflict can be contrasted with external conflict, which refers to the struggles and challenges that a character faces with outside forces, such as other characters, the environment, or society.<br /><br /></p><p><strong>Jangan lupa jadikan jawaban terbaik yaw..! :) ♥</strong></p><br />
