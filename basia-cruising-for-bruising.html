                                                                          Seeing Hawaii in Cruising Style
The Hawaiian language is based on five vowels and just seven consonants, but this is more than enough to utter the word "Aloha". This greeting written out in lights already welcomes those arriving at Honolulu airport, but it is in fact much more than a greeting or farewell.
Aloha means love and well-being and somehow stands for everything that goes to make up the image of Hawaii, from colourful shirts, through flower garlands and grass skirts to coconut bikinis.
Hawaii is the "Aloha State" and the 50th state of the United States of America. A visitor to these islands in the middle of the Pacific feels immediately that he has one foot firmly anchored in the American Way of Life, and this is particularly true when he sees the islands from the vantage point of a cruise ship.
"Aloha. How are you today?" is a frequently asked question on the "Pride of Aloha". The simple response, "Fine", or Mahalo in Hawaiian, suffices as answer.
The passenger aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line vessel would have little reason to respond otherwise. At breakfast, travellers are greeted by mountains of ham and pancakes, and this is the pattern throughout the day.
Most of the almost 2,000 aboard have their homes in the U.S. Midwest, where there is general scorn at the notion of going on diet.
The Pride of Aloha bears witness to this attitude, consuming 9,700 kilograms of meat during the sevenday cruise – the equivalent of 700 grams per passenger per day.
The Norwegian Cruise Line is no more Norwegian than the food aboard the Pride of Aloha is Hawaiian.
The cruise ship belongs to Star Cruises, the third-largest cruise operator in the world, and the Pride of Aloha was built in 1999, initially bearing the name Norwegian Sky. In 2004 it was converted for duty on the Pacific cruise route and is the first cruise ship to fly the U.S. flag in some time.
A cruise aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line vessel is perhaps the most comfortable and by no means the most exclusive way to see Hawaii. 
A cabin with a sea view costs as little as 1,250 euros per person for the seven nights of the cruise. Included in the price is full board, a nightly entertainment program and transfers between the four most important islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago, Oahu, Kauai, Big Island and Maui.
Honolulu on Oahu, where the cruise starts, has a population of 900,000 inhabitants and is the largest human settlement in the South Sea.
Faceless apartment blocks turn int equally faceless hotel towers and shoppinb malls in the seaside resort of Waikiki.
Thousands of Japanese butsle along the shopping streets Kalakaua and Kuhio avenues. There is a reaons for the crowds, the endless concrete and the activity; Waikiki beach is perhaps the most famous in the world after Copacabana.
But anyone who gazes out over the blue ocean to watch the surfers ride the perfect waves knows why he has come to Hawaii. One hopes at the same time that the evidence of human progress will become less apparent as the cruise progresses while the beach remains as beautiful.

                                            SkateboardA skateboard is sport equipment used for the activity of skateboarding. It consists of a specially designed maplewood board combined with a polyurethane coating in order to have smoother slides and stronger durability. Most skateboards are made with 7 plies of this wood.Many skateboards exist with exotic or alternative constructions. Traditional complete skateboards consist of the deck (often with grip tape applied on top to enhance traction), trucks (with urethane bushings), wheels (with sealed bearings), nuts, and bolts to fasten the truck and wheel assembly to the bottom of the deck. Recently, electric skateboards have appeared. These no longer require the propelling of the skateboard by means of the feet; rather an electric motor propels the board, fed by an electric battery.The board types depend largely upon its desired function. The two common types of skateboards are the longboard and the shortboard. Longboards are type of skateboards with longer wheelbases (over 33 inches long) and larger, softer wheels. Shortboards are type of skateboards which commonly have a rectangular shape kicktail at the back and a rounded nose in the front. They are usually less than 34 inches long. Besides, Longboards are usually faster and are mostly used for cruising and racing, while shortboards are mostly used for doing tricks.A skateboard can be used by simply standing on the deck while on a downward slope. By simply standing on the deck while on a downward slope, gravity will propel the board and rider.1. What is the purpose of the text above?

I really enjoyed my holiday in Australia. Last Sunday I visited a marine park called Sea World which is at surfers’ Paradise near Brisbane. It’s Australia’s largest marine park and I had a wonderful day there. 
The first thing I saw was the Oceanorium where you can watch all sorts of sea fish and animal under water. There were huge turtles, sharks, and a beautiful tropical sea fish. The most exciting thing was watching a man feeding the sharks. He wore a special diving suit. Then I watched the performance of sea animals. The saw was in a big outdoor swimming pool. There were killer whales, dolphins and sea lions, and they did all sort of fantastic things in the water. One of the girls in the show rode around the pool on the back of killing whale, and another girl rode underwater on the back of a big turtle. After the saw I had lunch. There were several big restaurant at the park and I had lunch in a restaurant that was shape like a ship! Then I watched a wonderful water-ski show which was held on a lake. 
There were lots of other things to do at the park. There was lake cruising, a train ride, a big water slide, swimming pools, and an incredible roller coaster called the ‘corkscrew’- because it goes three loops upside down. But I wish I had gone on the roller coaster ride before lunch rather than after it!

Seeing Hawaii in Cruising Style
    The Hawaiian language is based on five vowels and just seven consonants, but this is more than enough to utter the word "Aloha". This greeting written out in lights already welcomes those arriving at Honolulu airport, but it is in fact much more than a greeting or farewell.
     Aloha means love and well-being and somehow stands for everything that goes to make up the image of Hawaii, from colourful shirts, through flower garlands and grass skirts to coconut bikinis.
     Hawaii is the "Aloha State" and the 50th state of the United States of America. A visitor to these islands in the middle of the Pacific feels immediately that he has one foot firmly anchored in the American Way of Life, and this is particularly true when he sees the islands from the vantage point of a cruise ship.
     "Aloha. How are you today?" is a frequently asked question on the "Pride of Aloha". The simple response, "Fine", or Mahalo in Hawaiian, suffices as answer.
      The passenger aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line vessel would have little reason to respond otherwise. At breakfast, travellers are greeted by mountains of ham and pancakes, and this is the pattern throughout the day.
      Most of the almost 2,000 aboard have their homes in the U.S. Midwest, where there is general scorn at the notion of going on diet.
      The Pride of Aloha bears witness to this attitude, consuming 9,700 kilograms of meat during the sevenday cruise – the equivalent of 700 grams per passenger per day.
      The Norwegian Cruise Line is no more Norwegian than the food aboard the Pride of Aloha is Hawaiian.
      The cruise ship belongs to Star Cruises, the third-largest cruise operator in the world, and the Pride of Aloha was built in 1999, initially bearing the name Norwegian Sky. In 2004 it was converted for duty on the Pacific cruise route and is the first cruise ship to fly the U.S. flag in some time.
      A cruise aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line vessel is perhaps the most comfortable and by no means the most exclusive way to see Hawaii. 
       A cabin with a sea view costs as little as 1,250 euros per person for the seven nights of the cruise. Included in the price is full board, a nightly entertainment program and transfers between the four most important islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago, Oahu, Kauai, Big Island and Maui.
       Honolulu on Oahu, where the cruise starts, has a population of 900,000 inhabitants and is the largest human settlement in the South Sea.
       Faceless apartment blocks turn int equally faceless hotel towers and shoppinb malls in the seaside resort of Waikiki.
       Thousands of Japanese butsle along the shopping streets Kalakaua and Kuhio avenues. There is a reaons for the crowds, the endless concrete and the activity; Waikiki beach is perhaps the most famous in the world after Copacabana.
         But anyone who gazes out over the blue ocean to watch the surfers ride the perfect waves knows why he has come to Hawaii. One hopes at the same time that the evidence of human progress will become less apparent as the cruise progresses while the beach remains as beautiful.

                                            Questions 22 – 23 refer to the following information.
Situated in Pantai Indah Kapuk in North Jakarta, the Angke Kapuk natural tourism 
park covers an area of 99.82 hectares overlooking the Jakarta bay. With an entrance fee of Rp 
25,000 (US$1.87) per person for adults and Rp 10,000 for children, the place offers river 
cruising on a motorboat as well as walking and cycling around the forest through bamboo 
and wooden paths. A six-seat motorboat can be rented for Rp 350,000 per boat. A bigger 
size, which can accommodate up to eight people, is available for Rp 400,000. Fauna 
watching is one of the perks that visitors can expect to enjoy while cruising the mangrove 
forest. During our recent visit, several wild birds were standing at wooden poles scattered 
among the trees.
"If you arrive earlier in the morning, you can also see some lizards swimming in the 
river," said our boatman, Agus.
In addition to a bird watching area, which is best seen from a wooden bridge 
connecting one mangrove zone to another, there is also an avian nursery reachable by bike. 
When it is close to sunset, visitors can be found lingering at and around a 20-meter tower 
near the cottage area. Made entirely from wood, the accommodation options are perfect for 
those seeking to enjoy the lush trees and calm river overnight.

                                             Seeing Hawaii in Cruising Style
The Hawaiian language is based on five vowels and just seven consonants, but this is more than enough to utter the word "Aloha". This greeting written out in lights already welcomes those arriving at Honolulu airport, but it is in fact much more than a greeting or farewell.
Aloha means love and well-being and somehow stands for everything that goes to make up the image of Hawaii, from colourful shirts, through flower garlands and grass skirts to coconut bikinis.
Hawaii is the "Aloha State" and the 50th state of the United States of America. A visitor to these islands in the middle of the Pacific feels immediately that he has one foot firmly anchored in the American Way of Life, and this is particularly true when he sees the islands from the vantage point of a cruise ship.
"Aloha. How are you today?" is a frequently asked question on the "Pride of Aloha". The simple response, "Fine", or Mahalo in Hawaiian, suffices as answer.
The passenger aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line vessel would have little reason to respond otherwise. At breakfast, travellers are greeted by mountains of ham and pancakes, and this is the pattern throughout the day.
Most of the almost 2,000 aboard have their homes in the U.S. Midwest, where there is general scorn at the notion of going on diet.
The Pride of Aloha bears witness to this attitude, consuming 9,700 kilograms of meat during the sevenday cruise – the equivalent of 700 grams per passenger per day.

Ever noticed how the whole of the recruitment world seems to speak in code? Take one recent example: ‘Our client is prestigious (translation: arrogant and self-serving), recently restructured (downsized) company seeking to recruit (hello, that downsizing went a bit too far) a self-motivated (you’ll be on your own), hands-on (you’ll get no support), ambitious (24/7 is your world) business development (sales) director (the lower case ‘d’ means you won’t be on the board).’
Look closely at job advertising and you will find plenty pure rubbish too: a salary described as ‘circa $32,245’ (the implication being, presumably, that you could argue over the pence) pr, to quote from an ad for a communication director. ‘the successful candidate must have the proven ability to demonstrate the facility to exhibit a range of excellent communications skill – clearly necessary as the writer couldn’t.
Hidden away in all this code is the challenge to find which jobs you should apply for “The first rule of thumb is that you need to be at least “90%” there in meeting the minimum advertised requirements.’ Say Nick Marsh of recruiters Odgers International. An Important part the decoding is being able to spot an opportunity where you are needed and your skills are valued, ‘Oddly enough, your example of the recently restructured company probably represent a far better career opportunity tan if it were for a company that was cruising along quite successfully and quite comfortably,’ he says. ‘When companies are faced with challenges, there is the chance to make an impact, so the genuinely more exciting opportunities may well be with a company recruiting after restructure.’
Marsh says you should read every advertisement as a whole, trying to get feel for the overall flavour of the person required and the style of the organisation, rather than poring over every word and phrase. “You must also decide whether the type employer and the role appeal. If you’re not sure, do more research on the company. But most important, you must match the stated qualifications. I’m still amazed how many replies simply don’t meet the minimum requirements. Worse still, some candidates go through the whole process before considering the basics. To be offered the job and then say you don’t want to work in that town unforgivable and reflects badly on your own judgement. On the other hand, do not be deterred if the advertisement doesn’t give you all the information you might like. If details are left out – for example, employer identity or salary information – there will be good reasons for it, so don’t jump to conclusions.
Of course, the real trick is to be truly the ‘ideal candidate’, exactly matching all the requirements. In which casem you need to be selective, says Marsh. ‘Only apply for jibs where you can tick all the boxes. Job ads don’t tend to ask for an exhaustive list of requirements so, if you match the five stipulated criteria, create a CV and covering letter that explicitly demonstrates how you match each of those five. Better one such customised application than 20 standard CVs you sent off speculatively.
The bottom line is that the only jobs that are worth going for are those which are suitable for your core skills and Marsh points out, we all have only two or three things at which we truly excel. ‘Know what you’re outstandingly good at and focus on your applications based on those skills and you won’t go far wrong.’
1. One piece of advice Nick Marsh gives in the fourth paragraph is that
a. The absence of certain information should not be regarded with suspicion.
b. Employers are impressed it applicants have dobe research on their companies.
c. Location is a crucial factor when considering whether to accept an offer or not.
d. Studying adverts too closely can cause applicants to get the wrong impression.
2. In the fifth paragraph, Nick Marsh advises against
a. Making speculative job applications.
b. Exaggerating your suitability for a job.
c. Putting your own interpretation on a job advertisement.
d. Expecting to meet all the stated criteria.
3.What is meant in the context by the phrase ‘The bottom line’ (last paragraph)?
a. The minimum requirement
b. The final consideration
c. The most important point 
d. The unfortunate truth</a>

                                            The Legend Of Malin KundangLong time ago, in a tiny town near the coastline in West Sumatera, lived a female and her son, Malin Kundang. Malin Kundang’s papa had actually died when he was a child, as well as he had to live tough with his mom. Malin Kundang was a healthy, diligent, and also strong kid. He generally went to the sea to capture fish, as well as brought it to his mommy, or offered it in the community.One day, when Malin Kundang was cruising customarily, he saw a vendor’s ship which was being raided by a tiny band of pirates. With his take on and also power, Malin Kundang beat the pirates. The merchant was so happy and also asked Malin Kundang to cruise with him. Malin Kundang agreed.Several years later on, Malin Kundang ended up being a wealthy seller, with a substantial ship, lots of trading goods, numerous ship crews, as well as a beautiful wife. In his journey, his ship arrived on a coastline. The citizens recognized him, and the news ran quick in the community: Malin Kundang came to be an abundant male and now he is right here. His mother, in deepful sadnees after years of isolation, ran to the beach to fulfill her precious boy once again.When the mom came, Malin Kundang, in front of his well dressed other half, his teams and his own glory, rejected to satisfy that old, poor and filthy woman. For three times she pledge Malin Kundang and also for three times yelled at him. At last Malin Kundang said to her “Enough, old female! I have actually never ever had a mom like you, an unclean and also ugly peasant!” After that he bought his teams to set out.Angered, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would certainly turn into a stone if he didn’t apologize. Malin Kundang simply giggled as well as set sail.In the quiet sea, unexpectedly an electrical storm came. His substantial ship was damaged and it was far too late for Malin Kundang to said sorry. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship, fell on a tiny island, and instantly transformed into rockassalamualaikum, tolong bantu saya translate kedalam B.Indonesia yaaaterimakasih</a>

A skateboard consists of a specially designed maple wood board combined with a polyurethane coating in order to have smoother slides and stronger durability. Most skateboards are made with 7 plies of this wood. Many skateboards exist with exotic or alternative constructions. Traditional complete skateboards consist of the deck (often with grip tape applied on top to enhance traction), trucks (with urethane bushings), wheels (with sealed bearings), nuts, and bolts to fasten the truck and wheel assembly to the bottom of the deck. Recently, electric skateboards have appeared. These no longer require the propelling of the skateboard by means of the feet; rather an electric motor propels the board, fed by an electric battery. The board types depend largely upon· its desired function. The two common types of skateboards are the longboard and the shortboard. Longboards are the type of skateboards with longer wheelbases (over 33 inches Jong) and larger, softer wheels. Shortboards are the type of skateboards which commonly have a rectangular shape kick tail at the back and a rounded nose in the front. They are usually less than 34 inches long. Besides, longboards are usually faster and are mostly used for cruising and racing, while shortboards are mostly used for doing tricks.pertanyaan:1.The writer's purpose of the text is .... a.to describe to the readers about skateboards in generalb.to inform the readers about skateboarding equipment c.to explain how skateboards are classified d.to entertain the readers by describing skateboards e.to persuade the readers to try skateboarding 2.What can we conclude about a longboard? a.It is a good tool for pleasure. b.It is easy to use. c.It is flexible to modify. d.It is perfect for speed competition. e.It is usually used for maneuver. 3.How do you compare a.paragraph 2 and 3 in terms of the aim? b.Paragraph 2 describes the parts of the skateboard; c.paragraph 3 the types of skateboards. d.Paragraph 2 describes the skateboard construction; e.paragraph 3 the types of skateboards 4.The underlined word in "... combined with a polyurethane coating in order to have smoother slides and stronger durability" in paragraph  means ....a.stubility b.ability c.flagrancyd.enormity e.permanency ​</a>

Ever noticed how the whole of the recruitment world seems to speak in code? Take one recent example: ‘Our client is prestigious (translation: arrogant and self-serving), recently restructured (downsized) company seeking to recruit (hello, that downsizing went a bit too far) a self-motivated (you’ll be on your own), hands-on (you’ll get no support), ambitious (24/7 is your world) business development (sales) director (the lower case ‘d’ means you won’t be on the board).’
Look closely at job advertising and you will find plenty pure rubbish too: a salary described as ‘circa $32,245’ (the implication being, presumably, that you could argue over the pence) pr, to quote from an ad for a communication director. ‘the successful candidate must have the proven ability to demonstrate the facility to exhibit a range of excellent communications skill – clearly necessary as the writer couldn’t.
Hidden away in all this code is the challenge to find which jobs you should apply for “The first rule of thumb is that you need to be at least “90%” there in meeting the minimum advertised requirements.’ Say Nick Marsh of recruiters Odgers International. An Important part the decoding is being able to spot an opportunity where you are needed and your skills are valued, ‘Oddly enough, your example of the recently restructured company probably represent a far better career opportunity tan if it were for a company that was cruising along quite successfully and quite comfortably,’ he says. ‘When companies are faced with challenges, there is the chance to make an impact, so the genuinely more exciting opportunities may well be with a company recruiting after restructure.’
Marsh says you should read every advertisement as a whole, trying to get feel for the overall flavour of the person required and the style of the organisation, rather than poring over every word and phrase. “You must also decide whether the type employer and the role appeal. If you’re not sure, do more research on the company. But most important, you must match the stated qualifications. I’m still amazed how many replies simply don’t meet the minimum requirements. Worse still, some candidates go through the whole process before considering the basics. To be offered the job and then say you don’t want to work in that town unforgivable and reflects badly on your own judgement. On the other hand, do not be deterred if the advertisement doesn’t give you all the information you might like. If details are left out – for example, employer identity or salary information – there will be good reasons for it, so don’t jump to conclusions.
Of course, the real trick is to be truly the ‘ideal candidate’, exactly matching all the requirements. In which casem you need to be selective, says Marsh. ‘Only apply for jibs where you can tick all the boxes. Job ads don’t tend to ask for an exhaustive list of requirements so, if you match the five stipulated criteria, create a CV and covering letter that explicitly demonstrates how you match each of those five. Better one such customised application than 20 standard CVs you sent off speculatively.
The bottom line is that the only jobs that are worth going for are those which are suitable for your core skills and Marsh points out, we all have only two or three things at which we truly excel. ‘Know what you’re outstandingly good at and focus on your applications based on those skills and you won’t go far wrong.’
1. The writer’s aim in the first paragraph is to suggest that
a. Job advertisement should use simpler terms than they often do.
b. Certain terms have become fashionable in job advertisement.
c. The phrasing of many job advertisement is misleading.
d. Potential applicants should read job advertisements more carefully.
2. In the second paragraph, the writer refers to an advertisement that
a. Is open to various interpretations.
b. Is poorly phrased.
c. Exaggerates the requirements of the job.
d. Present information unlikely to be true.
3. In the third paragraph, Nick Marsh says that it can be a good idea to
a. Apply for jobs with companies that have a reputation for frequent change.
b. Look for companies whose recruitment policies are unusual.
c. Disregard some of what companies say in their job advertisements.
d. Apply to companies that may be seen as experiencing problems at the moments.</a>

I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man I had a master plan
But I was alone
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh what a night it's been, and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone
1-And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone
Always end up alone, always end up alone
So I'll play, I'll wait
'Cause you know that love takes time
Living love betwen the line
We came (sha la) so close (so far)
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mi-i-ine, and I don't wanna be alone
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
'Cause I know it isn't heaven is it love or hate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone
And is there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination another story there to be told
So I play sha la, I'll wait sha la
And I pray it's not too late
We came sha la so far so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart and it's mi-i-ine
And I don't wanna be alone
(repeat 1...)
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
I don't wanna be alone face the heat of the the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
You search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight I'm caught in the rain
And there's no one home</a>

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Pengaruh perubahan ruang dan interaksi antar ruang di benua yang ada di dunia adalah rata rata masyarakat di dunia melakukan interaksi antar ruang dari desa ke kota. Dampak positif yang di timbulkan adalah segala kebutuhan pangan yang diperlukan masyarakat kota ada di pedesaan dan segala kebutuhan teknologi masyarakat desa tersedia di perkotaaan dan inilah yang dinamakan hubungan timbal balik. Sedangkan dampak negative yang di timbulkan oleh interaksi antar ruang adalah banyaknya masyarakat desa yang melakukan perpindahan desa ke kota dan  hanya menimbulkan kemiskinan karena gagal untuk mencari pekerjaan di perkotaan.

</p><p>Pembahasan
</p><p>Hai teman-teman BrainlyLovers...!!! Sekarang kita akan membahas perubahan ruang dan interaksi antar ruang.  
</p><p>
</p><p>Selamat belajar...!!!  
</p><p>
</p><p>Perubahan ruang dan Interaksi Antarruang bisa terjadi dalam berbagai ruang lingkup ataupun skala. Dalam skala yang sempit, antara desa dengan kota terjadi perubahan ruang dan interaksi antarruang, dan dalam skala yang luas perubahan ruang dan interaksi antarruang dapat terjadi antar negara dan antar benua.
</p><p>
</p><p>Pengaruh perubahan ruang serta interaksi antarruang :
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Kehidupan Ekonomi
</p><p>
</p><p>Interaksi antarruang terjadi karena adanya kebutuhan akan barang dan jasa, oleh suatu negara yang tidak mampu diproduksi.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Kehidupan Sosial
</p><p>
</p><p>Interaksi antarnegara serta benua melibatkan pelaku utama adalah manusia. Interaksi sosial antara manusia dengan yang berbeda kehidupan sosialnya terjadi ketika terjadi interaksi dengan cara bertemu langsung (tatap wajah) atau melalui media komunikasi.

                            11.                               Seeing Hawaii in Cruising Style
The Hawaiian language is based on five vowels and just seven consonants, but this is more than enough to utter the word "Aloha". This greeting written out in lights already welcomes those arriving at Honolulu airport, but it is in fact much more than a greeting or farewell.
Aloha means love and well-being and somehow stands for everything that goes to make up the image of Hawaii, from colourful shirts, through flower garlands and grass skirts to coconut bikinis.
Hawaii is the "Aloha State" and the 50th state of the United States of America. A visitor to these islands in the middle of the Pacific feels immediately that he has one foot firmly anchored in the American Way of Life, and this is particularly true when he sees the islands from the vantage point of a cruise ship.
"Aloha. How are you today?" is a frequently asked question on the "Pride of Aloha". The simple response, "Fine", or Mahalo in Hawaiian, suffices as answer.
The passenger aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line vessel would have little reason to respond otherwise. At breakfast, travellers are greeted by mountains of ham and pancakes, and this is the pattern throughout the day.
Most of the almost 2,000 aboard have their homes in the U.S. Midwest, where there is general scorn at the notion of going on diet.
The Pride of Aloha bears witness to this attitude, consuming 9,700 kilograms of meat during the sevenday cruise – the equivalent of 700 grams per passenger per day.
The Norwegian Cruise Line is no more Norwegian than the food aboard the Pride of Aloha is Hawaiian.
The cruise ship belongs to Star Cruises, the third-largest cruise operator in the world, and the Pride of Aloha was built in 1999, initially bearing the name Norwegian Sky. In 2004 it was converted for duty on the Pacific cruise route and is the first cruise ship to fly the U.S. flag in some time.
A cruise aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line vessel is perhaps the most comfortable and by no means the most exclusive way to see Hawaii. 
A cabin with a sea view costs as little as 1,250 euros per person for the seven nights of the cruise. Included in the price is full board, a nightly entertainment program and transfers between the four most important islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago, Oahu, Kauai, Big Island and Maui.
Honolulu on Oahu, where the cruise starts, has a population of 900,000 inhabitants and is the largest human settlement in the South Sea.
Faceless apartment blocks turn int equally faceless hotel towers and shoppinb malls in the seaside resort of Waikiki.
Thousands of Japanese butsle along the shopping streets Kalakaua and Kuhio avenues. There is a reaons for the crowds, the endless concrete and the activity; Waikiki beach is perhaps the most famous in the world after Copacabana.
But anyone who gazes out over the blue ocean to watch the surfers ride the perfect waves knows why he has come to Hawaii. One hopes at the same time that the evidence of human progress will become less apparent as the cruise progresses while the beach remains as beautiful.

Decide in what paragraph you can find the following information!
Information.
1. The definition of "Aloha",
2. The reason why few passenger in the vessel don't respond to the greeting.
3. The history of Norwegin Cruise Line Vessel

                            15. SkateboardA skateboard is sport equipment used for the activity of skateboarding. It consists of a specially designed maplewood board combined with a polyurethane coating in order to have smoother slides and stronger durability. Most skateboards are made with 7 plies of this wood.Many skateboards exist with exotic or alternative constructions. Traditional complete skateboards consist of the deck (often with grip tape applied on top to enhance traction), trucks (with urethane bushings), wheels (with sealed bearings), nuts, and bolts to fasten the truck and wheel assembly to the bottom of the deck. Recently, electric skateboards have appeared. These no longer require the propelling of the skateboard by means of the feet; rather an electric motor propels the board, fed by an electric battery.The board types depend largely upon its desired function. The two common types of skateboards are the longboard and the shortboard. Longboards are type of skateboards with longer wheelbases (over 33 inches long) and larger, softer wheels. Shortboards are type of skateboards which commonly have a rectangular shape kicktail at the back and a rounded nose in the front. They are usually less than 34 inches long. Besides, Longboards are usually faster and are mostly used for cruising and racing, while shortboards are mostly used for doing tricks.A skateboard can be used by simply standing on the deck while on a downward slope. By simply standing on the deck while on a downward slope, gravity will propel the board and rider.1. What is the purpose of the text above?

                            17. The following text is for questions 35 and  36 
I really enjoyed my holiday in Australia. Last Sunday I visited a marine park called Sea World which is at surfers’ Paradise near Brisbane. It’s Australia’s largest marine park and I had a wonderful day there. 
The first thing I saw was the Oceanorium where you can watch all sorts of sea fish and animal under water. There were huge turtles, sharks, and a beautiful tropical sea fish. The most exciting thing was watching a man feeding the sharks. He wore a special diving suit. Then I watched the performance of sea animals. The saw was in a big outdoor swimming pool. There were killer whales, dolphins and sea lions, and they did all sort of fantastic things in the water. One of the girls in the show rode around the pool on the back of killing whale, and another girl rode underwater on the back of a big turtle. After the saw I had lunch. There were several big restaurant at the park and I had lunch in a restaurant that was shape like a ship! Then I watched a wonderful water-ski show which was held on a lake. 
There were lots of other things to do at the park. There was lake cruising, a train ride, a big water slide, swimming pools, and an incredible roller coaster called the ‘corkscrew’- because it goes three loops upside down. But I wish I had gone on the roller coaster ride before lunch rather than after it!

Seeing Hawaii in Cruising Style
    The Hawaiian language is based on five vowels and just seven consonants, but this is more than enough to utter the word "Aloha". This greeting written out in lights already welcomes those arriving at Honolulu airport, but it is in fact much more than a greeting or farewell.
     Aloha means love and well-being and somehow stands for everything that goes to make up the image of Hawaii, from colourful shirts, through flower garlands and grass skirts to coconut bikinis.
     Hawaii is the "Aloha State" and the 50th state of the United States of America. A visitor to these islands in the middle of the Pacific feels immediately that he has one foot firmly anchored in the American Way of Life, and this is particularly true when he sees the islands from the vantage point of a cruise ship.
     "Aloha. How are you today?" is a frequently asked question on the "Pride of Aloha". The simple response, "Fine", or Mahalo in Hawaiian, suffices as answer.
      The passenger aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line vessel would have little reason to respond otherwise. At breakfast, travellers are greeted by mountains of ham and pancakes, and this is the pattern throughout the day.
      Most of the almost 2,000 aboard have their homes in the U.S. Midwest, where there is general scorn at the notion of going on diet.
      The Pride of Aloha bears witness to this attitude, consuming 9,700 kilograms of meat during the sevenday cruise – the equivalent of 700 grams per passenger per day.
      The Norwegian Cruise Line is no more Norwegian than the food aboard the Pride of Aloha is Hawaiian.
      The cruise ship belongs to Star Cruises, the third-largest cruise operator in the world, and the Pride of Aloha was built in 1999, initially bearing the name Norwegian Sky. In 2004 it was converted for duty on the Pacific cruise route and is the first cruise ship to fly the U.S. flag in some time.
      A cruise aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line vessel is perhaps the most comfortable and by no means the most exclusive way to see Hawaii. 
       A cabin with a sea view costs as little as 1,250 euros per person for the seven nights of the cruise. Included in the price is full board, a nightly entertainment program and transfers between the four most important islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago, Oahu, Kauai, Big Island and Maui.
       Honolulu on Oahu, where the cruise starts, has a population of 900,000 inhabitants and is the largest human settlement in the South Sea.
       Faceless apartment blocks turn int equally faceless hotel towers and shoppinb malls in the seaside resort of Waikiki.
       Thousands of Japanese butsle along the shopping streets Kalakaua and Kuhio avenues. There is a reaons for the crowds, the endless concrete and the activity; Waikiki beach is perhaps the most famous in the world after Copacabana.
         But anyone who gazes out over the blue ocean to watch the surfers ride the perfect waves knows why he has come to Hawaii. One hopes at the same time that the evidence of human progress will become less apparent as the cruise progresses while the beach remains as beautiful.

                            23. Questions 22 – 23 refer to the following information.
Situated in Pantai Indah Kapuk in North Jakarta, the Angke Kapuk natural tourism 
park covers an area of 99.82 hectares overlooking the Jakarta bay. With an entrance fee of Rp 
25,000 (US$1.87) per person for adults and Rp 10,000 for children, the place offers river 
cruising on a motorboat as well as walking and cycling around the forest through bamboo 
and wooden paths. A six-seat motorboat can be rented for Rp 350,000 per boat. A bigger 
size, which can accommodate up to eight people, is available for Rp 400,000. Fauna 
watching is one of the perks that visitors can expect to enjoy while cruising the mangrove 
forest. During our recent visit, several wild birds were standing at wooden poles scattered 
among the trees.
"If you arrive earlier in the morning, you can also see some lizards swimming in the 
river," said our boatman, Agus.
In addition to a bird watching area, which is best seen from a wooden bridge 
connecting one mangrove zone to another, there is also an avian nursery reachable by bike. 
When it is close to sunset, visitors can be found lingering at and around a 20-meter tower 
near the cottage area. Made entirely from wood, the accommodation options are perfect for 
those seeking to enjoy the lush trees and calm river overnight.

Ever noticed how the whole of the recruitment world seems to speak in code? Take one recent example: ‘Our client is prestigious (translation: arrogant and self-serving), recently restructured (downsized) company seeking to recruit (hello, that downsizing went a bit too far) a self-motivated (you’ll be on your own), hands-on (you’ll get no support), ambitious (24/7 is your world) business development (sales) director (the lower case ‘d’ means you won’t be on the board).’
Look closely at job advertising and you will find plenty pure rubbish too: a salary described as ‘circa $32,245’ (the implication being, presumably, that you could argue over the pence) pr, to quote from an ad for a communication director. ‘the successful candidate must have the proven ability to demonstrate the facility to exhibit a range of excellent communications skill – clearly necessary as the writer couldn’t.
Hidden away in all this code is the challenge to find which jobs you should apply for “The first rule of thumb is that you need to be at least “90%” there in meeting the minimum advertised requirements.’ Say Nick Marsh of recruiters Odgers International. An Important part the decoding is being able to spot an opportunity where you are needed and your skills are valued, ‘Oddly enough, your example of the recently restructured company probably represent a far better career opportunity tan if it were for a company that was cruising along quite successfully and quite comfortably,’ he says. ‘When companies are faced with challenges, there is the chance to make an impact, so the genuinely more exciting opportunities may well be with a company recruiting after restructure.’
Marsh says you should read every advertisement as a whole, trying to get feel for the overall flavour of the person required and the style of the organisation, rather than poring over every word and phrase. “You must also decide whether the type employer and the role appeal. If you’re not sure, do more research on the company. But most important, you must match the stated qualifications. I’m still amazed how many replies simply don’t meet the minimum requirements. Worse still, some candidates go through the whole process before considering the basics. To be offered the job and then say you don’t want to work in that town unforgivable and reflects badly on your own judgement. On the other hand, do not be deterred if the advertisement doesn’t give you all the information you might like. If details are left out – for example, employer identity or salary information – there will be good reasons for it, so don’t jump to conclusions.
Of course, the real trick is to be truly the ‘ideal candidate’, exactly matching all the requirements. In which casem you need to be selective, says Marsh. ‘Only apply for jibs where you can tick all the boxes. Job ads don’t tend to ask for an exhaustive list of requirements so, if you match the five stipulated criteria, create a CV and covering letter that explicitly demonstrates how you match each of those five. Better one such customised application than 20 standard CVs you sent off speculatively.
The bottom line is that the only jobs that are worth going for are those which are suitable for your core skills and Marsh points out, we all have only two or three things at which we truly excel. ‘Know what you’re outstandingly good at and focus on your applications based on those skills and you won’t go far wrong.’
1. One piece of advice Nick Marsh gives in the fourth paragraph is that
a. The absence of certain information should not be regarded with suspicion.
b. Employers are impressed it applicants have dobe research on their companies.
c. Location is a crucial factor when considering whether to accept an offer or not.
d. Studying adverts too closely can cause applicants to get the wrong impression.
2. In the fifth paragraph, Nick Marsh advises against
a. Making speculative job applications.
b. Exaggerating your suitability for a job.
c. Putting your own interpretation on a job advertisement.
d. Expecting to meet all the stated criteria.
3.What is meant in the context by the phrase ‘The bottom line’ (last paragraph)?
a. The minimum requirement

Malin Kundang’s papa had actually died when he was a child, as well as he had to live tough with his mom. Malin Kundang was a healthy, diligent, and also strong kid. He generally went to the sea to capture fish, as well as brought it to his mommy, or offered it in the community.One day, when Malin Kundang was cruising customarily, he saw a vendor’s ship which was being raided by a tiny band of pirates. With his take on and also power, Malin Kundang beat the pirates. The merchant was so happy and also asked Malin Kundang to cruise with him. Malin Kundang agreed.Several years later on, Malin Kundang ended up being a wealthy seller, with a substantial ship, lots of trading goods, numerous ship crews, as well as a beautiful wife. In his journey, his ship arrived on a coastline. The citizens recognized him, and the news ran quick in the community: Malin Kundang came to be an abundant male and now he is right here. His mother, in deepful sadnees after years of isolation, ran to the beach to fulfill her precious boy once again.When the mom came, Malin Kundang, in front of his well dressed other half, his teams and his own glory, rejected to satisfy that old, poor and filthy woman. For three times she pledge Malin Kundang and also for three times yelled at him. At last Malin Kundang said to her “Enough, old female! I have actually never ever had a mom like you, an unclean and also ugly peasant!” After that he bought his teams to set out.Angered, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would certainly turn into a stone if he didn’t apologize. Malin Kundang simply giggled as well as set sail.In the quiet sea, unexpectedly an electrical storm came. His substantial ship was damaged and it was far too late for Malin Kundang to said sorry. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship, fell on a tiny island, and instantly transformed into rockassalamualaikum, tolong bantu saya translate kedalam B.Indonesia yaaaterimakasih</h2><br />

                            33.                          Skateboards Skateboards are sport equipment used for the activity of skateboarding. A skateboard consists of a specially designed maple wood board combined with a polyurethane coating in order to have smoother slides and stronger durability. Most skateboards are made with 7 plies of this wood. Many skateboards exist with exotic or alternative constructions. Traditional complete skateboards consist of the deck (often with grip tape applied on top to enhance traction), trucks (with urethane bushings), wheels (with sealed bearings), nuts, and bolts to fasten the truck and wheel assembly to the bottom of the deck. Recently, electric skateboards have appeared. These no longer require the propelling of the skateboard by means of the feet; rather an electric motor propels the board, fed by an electric battery. The board types depend largely upon· its desired function. The two common types of skateboards are the longboard and the shortboard. Longboards are the type of skateboards with longer wheelbases (over 33 inches Jong) and larger, softer wheels. Shortboards are the type of skateboards which commonly have a rectangular shape kick tail at the back and a rounded nose in the front. They are usually less than 34 inches long. Besides, longboards are usually faster and are mostly used for cruising and racing, while shortboards are mostly used for doing tricks.pertanyaan:1.The writer's purpose of the text is .... a.to describe to the readers about skateboards in generalb.to inform the readers about skateboarding equipment c.to explain how skateboards are classified d.to entertain the readers by describing skateboards e.to persuade the readers to try skateboarding 2.What can we conclude about a longboard? a.It is a good tool for pleasure. b.It is easy to use. c.It is flexible to modify. d.It is perfect for speed competition. e.It is usually used for maneuver. 3.How do you compare a.paragraph 2 and 3 in terms of the aim? b.Paragraph 2 describes the parts of the skateboard; c.paragraph 3 the types of skateboards. d.Paragraph 2 describes the skateboard construction; e.paragraph 3 the types of skateboards 4.The underlined word in "... combined with a polyurethane coating in order to have smoother slides and stronger durability" in paragraph  means ....a.stubility b.ability c.flagrancyd.enormity e.permanency ​</h2><br />

                            37. Bantuin tugas sekolah saya ya...
Ever noticed how the whole of the recruitment world seems to speak in code? Take one recent example: ‘Our client is prestigious (translation: arrogant and self-serving), recently restructured (downsized) company seeking to recruit (hello, that downsizing went a bit too far) a self-motivated (you’ll be on your own), hands-on (you’ll get no support), ambitious (24/7 is your world) business development (sales) director (the lower case ‘d’ means you won’t be on the board).’
Look closely at job advertising and you will find plenty pure rubbish too: a salary described as ‘circa $32,245’ (the implication being, presumably, that you could argue over the pence) pr, to quote from an ad for a communication director. ‘the successful candidate must have the proven ability to demonstrate the facility to exhibit a range of excellent communications skill – clearly necessary as the writer couldn’t.
Hidden away in all this code is the challenge to find which jobs you should apply for “The first rule of thumb is that you need to be at least “90%” there in meeting the minimum advertised requirements.’ Say Nick Marsh of recruiters Odgers International. An Important part the decoding is being able to spot an opportunity where you are needed and your skills are valued, ‘Oddly enough, your example of the recently restructured company probably represent a far better career opportunity tan if it were for a company that was cruising along quite successfully and quite comfortably,’ he says. ‘When companies are faced with challenges, there is the chance to make an impact, so the genuinely more exciting opportunities may well be with a company recruiting after restructure.’
Marsh says you should read every advertisement as a whole, trying to get feel for the overall flavour of the person required and the style of the organisation, rather than poring over every word and phrase. “You must also decide whether the type employer and the role appeal. If you’re not sure, do more research on the company. But most important, you must match the stated qualifications. I’m still amazed how many replies simply don’t meet the minimum requirements. Worse still, some candidates go through the whole process before considering the basics. To be offered the job and then say you don’t want to work in that town unforgivable and reflects badly on your own judgement. On the other hand, do not be deterred if the advertisement doesn’t give you all the information you might like. If details are left out – for example, employer identity or salary information – there will be good reasons for it, so don’t jump to conclusions.
Of course, the real trick is to be truly the ‘ideal candidate’, exactly matching all the requirements. In which casem you need to be selective, says Marsh. ‘Only apply for jibs where you can tick all the boxes. Job ads don’t tend to ask for an exhaustive list of requirements so, if you match the five stipulated criteria, create a CV and covering letter that explicitly demonstrates how you match each of those five. Better one such customised application than 20 standard CVs you sent off speculatively.
The bottom line is that the only jobs that are worth going for are those which are suitable for your core skills and Marsh points out, we all have only two or three things at which we truly excel. ‘Know what you’re outstandingly good at and focus on your applications based on those skills and you won’t go far wrong.’
1. The writer’s aim in the first paragraph is to suggest that
a. Job advertisement should use simpler terms than they often do.
b. Certain terms have become fashionable in job advertisement.
c. The phrasing of many job advertisement is misleading.
d. Potential applicants should read job advertisements more carefully.
2. In the second paragraph, the writer refers to an advertisement that
a. Is open to various interpretations.
b. Is poorly phrased.
c. Exaggerates the requirements of the job.
d. Present information unlikely to be true.
3. In the third paragraph, Nick Marsh says that it can be a good idea to
a. Apply for jobs with companies that have a reputation for frequent change.
b. Look for companies whose recruitment policies are unusual.
c. Disregard some of what companies say in their job advertisements.
d. Apply to companies that may be seen as experiencing problems at the moments.</h2><br />

I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man I had a master plan
But I was alone
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh what a night it's been, and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone
1-And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone
Always end up alone, always end up alone
So I'll play, I'll wait
'Cause you know that love takes time
Living love betwen the line
We came (sha la) so close (so far)
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mi-i-ine, and I don't wanna be alone
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
'Cause I know it isn't heaven is it love or hate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone
And is there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination another story there to be told
So I play sha la, I'll wait sha la
And I pray it's not too late
We came sha la so far so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart and it's mi-i-ine
And I don't wanna be alone
(repeat 1...)
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
I don't wanna be alone face the heat of the the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
You search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight I'm caught in the rain
And there's no one home</h2><br />
