                                            KUNMING Kunming is known fondly to its two million inhabitants as the City of Eternal Spring. It is just north of the Tropic of Cancer and sits on a plateau 2000- meters above sea-level To get a feel of the city, it's necessary to travel by bus, bicycle or on foot Walking is a pleasure in this city Wide footpaths under tall, shady trees are well planned for pedestrians, while the twisting backlanes present a more traditional aspect of life in a modern city. The combination of hilltribe dresses. Mao suits and western fashions worn by the locals give the city a special feel, as if it has one foot in the past and the other in the future. This feeling is reinforced by the daily activities people are engaged in -- from selling coal from a horse-drawn cart to offering computer tuition on the street. By 7 am each morning, Green Lake, Park, along with many other areas around the city, is full of people performing tai chi, the 1 ancient and graceful martial art which promotes mental and physical health. As the day progresses, children paddle boats on the lake, old men and women play mahjong and young couples sit dreamy-eyed on beaches by the water. in various corners of the park, groups of people with weather-beaten faces, play Chinese musical instruments and sing folk songs and dance, just celebrating the joy of life. Outside, the park, vendors sell fresh pineapple and soft drinks, while masseurs offer to case aches and pains for a small fee. There are also several other favorite hangouts in this pleasant city, such as the zoo, which has a wide variety of animals, and "The Square, an area of fountains, flowerbeds and benches in the heart of town, where there is always something happening, whether it be kite-flying, or a schoolchildren's parade. are Night life is picking up as the people grow more affluent and there are several popular bars and karaoke bars mushrooming Many of the hotels have discotheques and guests can enjoy good food while watching traditional songs and dances performed by Sani girls There are several other attractions that lie within easy reach of the city, such as the National Minorities Park at Haigeng, on the banks of Lake Dianchi 15 km southeast of the city. the lake, also called the Kunming Lake, is protected by Jinma Mountain to the east and Biji Mountain to the west. A series of pathways connects the traditional villages of the Dai Bai, Wa, Yi and other ethnic tribes of Yunnan. The villages are populated by tribespeople who enact traditional dances for visitors To the west north from town lie Western Hills and the Bamboo Temple respectively. The route up Western Hills passes two wonderful temples, Huating and Taihua. It would be easy to spend hours just exploring the temple grounds, but the goal of most who go up the hill is the Dragon Gate A tunnel along the cliff leads to a fantastic view over Lake Dianchi and Kunming. The Bamboo Temple, on the other hand, is a fine example of an ancient temple with a quiet, respectful atmosphere, Rooms near the entrance are crowded with lifelike statues and the air is thick with incense. Probably, the most interesting day trip is to the Stone Forest, a wonderland of natural rockscapes weathered into all manner of shapes and sizes. The Stone Forest was formed during 1 Page 10 the Paleozoic Era. There are stone peaks, pillars, shoots, stalactites, stalagmites, corroded land surface, underground rivers and caves. Located 30 kilometers from the Stone Forest is the Alu Cave which is also worth a visit. Here, there are rivers, stalactites, stalagmites, stone flowers, stone pillars and stone falls -- all in the cave. The Qiongzhu Temple, located on the Yu'an Mountain in the northwest of Kunming, was the first temple through which the Chan sect of Buddhism was spread the Heilong (Black Dragon Pool) is a scenic spot located on the Wulao Mountain in the northwestern suburbs of Kunming. The pool contains very clear water legend has it that there used to be 10 dragons here. As they often caused havoc to the villagers, Lu Dongbin, a Taoist master caught nine of them and locked them in the Zhedong Tower. He ordered the 10th, a small black dragon, to contribute to the welfare of the local people. In honor of its contribution, the villagers decided to name the pool Heilongquestion2.

                                            The Grand Mosque of Buntet PesantrenThe Grand Mosque of Buntet Pesantren or also known as Masjid Agung Buntet Pesantren is probably one of the oldest Mosques in Cirebon. It is also the most popular landmark in Buntet Pesantren, an Islamic boarding institution located in Kabupaten Cirebon, West Java.Built in the era of Kyai Abdul Jamil 18421919 the mosque has unique characteristics. One of the interesting thing about the mosque is the rooftop. Unlike many other mosques, there is no dome on top of this mosque. Instead, the rooftop resembles the one which is usually found on a Hindu temple. This is similar to some older mosques across the Java island such as the Grand Mosque of Demak. It is believed to be the acculturation of the Islamic and Hindu architecture.Getting to the mosque, there are five staircases that symbolize the five pillars of Islam. Entering the mosque, there are nine doors which lead to the inner part of the mosque. The number is believed to symbolize the number of the Islamic saints (wali) who helped spread Islam across the archipelago. On the sides of the mosque, there are two rooms, one on each side. This symbolizes the two Islamic creeds or syahadat. Although this mosque has gone through several times of renovations, the original architecture remains the same.1. what is the text about?2. what does paragraph 1 talk about?3. what are the parts of the mosques described in the text?​</a>

                                            I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
Now the old king is dead, long live the king!
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, my shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Ooooh)
Ah, who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh
(repeat with chorus)
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, my shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Oooooooh Oooooooh Oooooooh

                                            2. Read the passage below and answer the following questions. Isles of Scilly, also called Scilly Isles, is a group of about 50 small islands and many more islets lying southwest of Cornwall, England. It is just approximately 40 to 58 km off Land's End. The administrative centre is on St. Mary's, the largest island in the group. Because the islands' climate is exceptionally mild, their fauna and flora are quite different from those on the English mainland. There are prehistoric remains in the form of barrows and rude pillars on the islands. (1) Henry I gave the islands to the abbot of Tavistock in Devon. In the 16th century, they became crown property and were leased in 1571 to Francis Godolphin, who built Star Castle above Hugh Town in 1593. During the English Civil Wars (1642–51), the islands were controlled by supporters of the monarchy, whose navy caused severe damage to Dutch ships. The Netherlands, which had been rebuffed after demanding reparation for losses, declared war against the islands in 1651. (2) Soon after, Parliament's supporters gained control of the islands. The war subsequently ended, although a formal peace treaty was not signed until April 17, 1986. In 1834 Augustus Smith succeeded the Godolphins as the islands' lessee, and in 1933 the main islands were handed over to the British crown. Only five of the islands are inhabited—St. Mary's, Tresco, St. Martin's, Bryher, and St. Agnes. Most of the people live on St. Mary's, which has a harbour at Hugh Town and a museum of Scilly history and prehistory. Bishop Rock Lighthouse, which was constructed in 1858 at the islands' western end, is a notable example of 19"-century civil engineering. The economy is based on tourism and on commercial flower growing and vegetable farming, the latter made possible by the prevailing mild climate. (3) Fishing is also significant. There is ferry service to Penzance, on the mainland, and flights connect the islands to the Land's End, Newquay, and Exeter airports. a) Identify the most suitable title for the text.​</a>

It is also the most popular landmark in Buntet Pesantren, an Islamic boarding institution located in Kabupaten Cirebon, West Java.Built in the era of Kyai Abdul Jamil 18421919 the mosque has unique characteristics. One of the interesting thing about the mosque is the rooftop. Unlike many other mosques, there is no dome on top of this mosque. Instead, the rooftop resembles the one which is usually found on a Hindu temple. This is similar to some older mosques across the Java island such as the Grand Mosque of Demak. It is believed to be the acculturation of the Islamic and Hindu architecture.Getting to the mosque, there are five staircases that symbolize the five pillars of Islam. Entering the mosque, there are nine doors which lead to the inner part of the mosque. The number is believed to symbolize the number of the Islamic saints (wali) who helped spread Islam across the archipelago. On the sides of the mosque, there are two rooms, one on each side. This symbolizes the two Islamic creeds or syahadat. Although this mosque has gone through several times of renovations, the original architecture remains the same.PERTANYAAN!give examples from the text for the following linguistic features:1. simple present text2. adjective3. noun or noun phrase4. passive voice​​</a>

                                            Limestone caves can be spectacular structures filled with giant stalactites and stalagmites. These caves are formed when rainwater, which is a weak acid, dissolves calcite, or lime, out of limestone. Over time, the lime-laden water drips down into cracks, enlarging them into caves. Some of the lime is then redeposited to form stalactites and stalagmites. Stalactites, which grow down from cave ceilings, are formed in limestone caves when groundwater containing dissolved lime drips from the roof of the cave and leaves a thin deposit as it evaporates. Stalactites generally grow only a fraction of an inch each year, but over time a considerable number may grow to be several yards long. In cases where the supply of water is seasonal, they may actually have growth rings resembling those on tree trunks that indicate how old the stalactites are. Stalagmites are formed on the floor of a limestone cave where water containing dissolved lime has dripped either from the cave ceiling or from a stalactite above. They develop in the same way as stalactites, when water containing dissolved limestone evaporates. In some limestone caves with mature limestone development, stalactites and stalagmites grow together, creating limestone pillars that stretch from the cave floor to the cave ceiling. 10. It is indicated in paragraph 1 that all of the following are part of the process of forming limestone caves EXCEPT that (A) rainwater dissolves lime from limestone (B) the lime-filled water seeps into breaks in the ground (C) the lime in the water evaporates (D) the cracks in the ground develop into caves 11. According to paragraph 2, it is NOT true that stalactites (A) enlarge cave ceilings (B) are found in limestone caves (C) grow in a downward direction (D) grow quite slowly 12. It is NOT mentioned in paragraph 2 (A) how long stalactites may grow (B) how the age of the stalactite is determined (C) what one of the effects of a limited water supply is (D) what causes stalactites to disappear 13. According to paragraph 3, stalagmites are NOT formed (A) on cave floors (B) from lime dissolved in water (C) above stalactites (D) as water containing lime evaporates14. It is NOT indicated in paragraph 3 that limestone pillars (A) result when a stalactite and a stalagmite grow together (B) are attached to both the floor and the ceiling of a cave (C) are relatively aged limestone formations (D) are more durable than stalactites and stalagmitesmohon dibantu terimakasih ​</a>

                        <p>the first pillar of Islam is the Shahada, the assertion of faith, combining the themes of unity and mercy that are found in the Quran. There are two shahadas: "There is no god but God" and "Muhammad is the messenger of God". This set statement is normally recited in Arabic: lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu muḥammadun rasūlu-llāh (لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا الله مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ الله) "There is no god but God (and) Muhammad is the messenger of God."

                            8. KUNMING Kunming is known fondly to its two million inhabitants as the City of Eternal Spring. It is just north of the Tropic of Cancer and sits on a plateau 2000- meters above sea-level To get a feel of the city, it's necessary to travel by bus, bicycle or on foot Walking is a pleasure in this city Wide footpaths under tall, shady trees are well planned for pedestrians, while the twisting backlanes present a more traditional aspect of life in a modern city. The combination of hilltribe dresses. Mao suits and western fashions worn by the locals give the city a special feel, as if it has one foot in the past and the other in the future. This feeling is reinforced by the daily activities people are engaged in -- from selling coal from a horse-drawn cart to offering computer tuition on the street. By 7 am each morning, Green Lake, Park, along with many other areas around the city, is full of people performing tai chi, the 1 ancient and graceful martial art which promotes mental and physical health. As the day progresses, children paddle boats on the lake, old men and women play mahjong and young couples sit dreamy-eyed on beaches by the water. in various corners of the park, groups of people with weather-beaten faces, play Chinese musical instruments and sing folk songs and dance, just celebrating the joy of life. Outside, the park, vendors sell fresh pineapple and soft drinks, while masseurs offer to case aches and pains for a small fee. There are also several other favorite hangouts in this pleasant city, such as the zoo, which has a wide variety of animals, and "The Square, an area of fountains, flowerbeds and benches in the heart of town, where there is always something happening, whether it be kite-flying, or a schoolchildren's parade. are Night life is picking up as the people grow more affluent and there are several popular bars and karaoke bars mushrooming Many of the hotels have discotheques and guests can enjoy good food while watching traditional songs and dances performed by Sani girls There are several other attractions that lie within easy reach of the city, such as the National Minorities Park at Haigeng, on the banks of Lake Dianchi 15 km southeast of the city. the lake, also called the Kunming Lake, is protected by Jinma Mountain to the east and Biji Mountain to the west. A series of pathways connects the traditional villages of the Dai Bai, Wa, Yi and other ethnic tribes of Yunnan. The villages are populated by tribespeople who enact traditional dances for visitors To the west north from town lie Western Hills and the Bamboo Temple respectively. The route up Western Hills passes two wonderful temples, Huating and Taihua. It would be easy to spend hours just exploring the temple grounds, but the goal of most who go up the hill is the Dragon Gate A tunnel along the cliff leads to a fantastic view over Lake Dianchi and Kunming. The Bamboo Temple, on the other hand, is a fine example of an ancient temple with a quiet, respectful atmosphere, Rooms near the entrance are crowded with lifelike statues and the air is thick with incense. Probably, the most interesting day trip is to the Stone Forest, a wonderland of natural rockscapes weathered into all manner of shapes and sizes. The Stone Forest was formed during 1 Page 10 the Paleozoic Era. There are stone peaks, pillars, shoots, stalactites, stalagmites, corroded land surface, underground rivers and caves. Located 30 kilometers from the Stone Forest is the Alu Cave which is also worth a visit. Here, there are rivers, stalactites, stalagmites, stone flowers, stone pillars and stone falls -- all in the cave. The Qiongzhu Temple, located on the Yu'an Mountain in the northwest of Kunming, was the first temple through which the Chan sect of Buddhism was spread the Heilong (Black Dragon Pool) is a scenic spot located on the Wulao Mountain in the northwestern suburbs of Kunming. The pool contains very clear water legend has it that there used to be 10 dragons here. As they often caused havoc to the villagers, Lu Dongbin, a Taoist master caught nine of them and locked them in the Zhedong Tower. He ordered the 10th, a small black dragon, to contribute to the welfare of the local people. In honor of its contribution, the villagers decided to name the pool Heilongquestion2.

                        <p>Berikut adalah beberapa perbedaan antara model literasi seven pillars dan the big six:</p><p></p>Model literasi seven pillars dikembangkan oleh SCONUL (Standing Conference of National and University Libraries) di Inggris, sedangkan model literasi the big six dikembangkan oleh Mike Eisenberg dan Bob Berkowitz di Amerika Serikat¹².Model literasi seven pillars terdiri dari tujuh pilar, yaitu identify, scope, plan, gather, evaluate, manage, dan present. Model literasi the big six terdiri dari enam langkah, yaitu task definition, information seeking strategies, location and access, use of information, synthesis, dan evaluation.Model literasi seven pillars lebih menekankan pada aspek kognitif dan afektif dari literasi informasi, seperti kemampuan untuk mengidentifikasi kebutuhan informasi, merencanakan strategi pencarian informasi, mengevaluasi kualitas informasi, dan menyajikan informasi dengan etis. Model literasi the big six lebih menekankan pada aspek teknis dan prosedural dari literasi informasi, seperti keterampilan untuk menemukan dan mengakses informasi, menggunakan informasi dari berbagai sumber, dan menyintesis informasi menjadi produk akhir.Model literasi seven pillars lebih fleksibel dan adaptif terhadap konteks yang berbeda-beda, seperti bidang studi, tingkat pendidikan, atau tujuan pembelajaran. Model literasi the big six lebih linear dan sistematis dalam mengikuti langkah-langkah pemecahan masalah. <p></p><p><strong>JANGAN LUPA LIKE DAN BINTANG NYA JIKA JAWABAN NYA MEMUASKAN DAN JADIKAN JAWABAN TERBAIK, SEMOGA TERBANTU (≡^∇^≡)</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Entering the mosque, there are nine doors which lead to the inner part of the mosque.

                            24. I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
Now the old king is dead, long live the king!
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, my shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Ooooh)
Ah, who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh
(repeat with chorus)
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, my shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Oooooooh Oooooooh Oooooooh

Some say that they fast for only three days. This also existed in the early days of Islam. There are also those who say that what they are doing is fasting Ashura (10 Muharram).The purpose of fasting is so that we become pious.Based on Allah's command in the Qur'an Surah Al Baqarah: 183 "O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you so that you may become pious"Based on the Qur'an Surah Al Baqarah: 183 God says fasting can make you become pious.Apart from taqwa, what we get from fasting is a healthy body.No, because every religion has its own way of manifesting its worship.Because faith is a belief. The specific characteristic of fasting are the doors or Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are locked, whoever fasts during Ramadan anticipating Allah’s reward will have his sins forgiven, the Quran was revealed during this month.Because fasting can suppress lust.

It is the sum total of all Islamic spirit and morality. It is a quality in the life of the believer that makes him/her aware of Allah at all times.

                            27. 2. Read the passage below and answer the following questions. Isles of Scilly, also called Scilly Isles, is a group of about 50 small islands and many more islets lying southwest of Cornwall, England. It is just approximately 40 to 58 km off Land's End. The administrative centre is on St. Mary's, the largest island in the group. Because the islands' climate is exceptionally mild, their fauna and flora are quite different from those on the English mainland. There are prehistoric remains in the form of barrows and rude pillars on the islands. (1) Henry I gave the islands to the abbot of Tavistock in Devon. In the 16th century, they became crown property and were leased in 1571 to Francis Godolphin, who built Star Castle above Hugh Town in 1593. During the English Civil Wars (1642–51), the islands were controlled by supporters of the monarchy, whose navy caused severe damage to Dutch ships. The Netherlands, which had been rebuffed after demanding reparation for losses, declared war against the islands in 1651. (2) Soon after, Parliament's supporters gained control of the islands. The war subsequently ended, although a formal peace treaty was not signed until April 17, 1986. In 1834 Augustus Smith succeeded the Godolphins as the islands' lessee, and in 1933 the main islands were handed over to the British crown. Only five of the islands are inhabited—St. Mary's, Tresco, St. Martin's, Bryher, and St. Agnes. Most of the people live on St. Mary's, which has a harbour at Hugh Town and a museum of Scilly history and prehistory. Bishop Rock Lighthouse, which was constructed in 1858 at the islands' western end, is a notable example of 19"-century civil engineering. The economy is based on tourism and on commercial flower growing and vegetable farming, the latter made possible by the prevailing mild climate. (3) Fishing is also significant. There is ferry service to Penzance, on the mainland, and flights connect the islands to the Land's End, Newquay, and Exeter airports. a) Identify the most suitable title for the text.​</h2><br />

                            30. Einstein developed the theory of relativity one of the pillars of modern physics​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ eyen-styne;[4] bahasa Jerman: [ˈalbɛɐ̯t ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] ( simak); 14 Maret 1879 – 18 April 1955) adalah fisikawan teoretis kelahiran Jerman[5] yang mengembangkan teori relativitas, satu dari dua pilar utama fisika modern (bersama mekanika kuantum).[3][6]:274 Karya-karyanya juga dikenal karena berpengaruh terhadap filsafat ilmu.[7][8] Persamaan Einstein yang paling dikenal adalah rumus kesetaraan massa-energi {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}{\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}, yang dijuluki "persamaan paling terkenal di dunia".[9] Einstein menerima Nobel Fisika pada tahun 1921 "atas jasanya terhadap fisika teoretis, dan khususnya atas penemuannya tentang hukum efek fotolistrik",[10] yang menjadi langkah penting dalam pengembangan teori kuantum.
</p><p>
</p><p>Menjelang awal kariernya, Einstein berpendapat bahwa mekanika Newton tak lagi mampu menyatukan hukum mekanika klasik dengan hukum medan elektromagnetik. Hal ini mendorongnya mengembangkan teori relativitas khusus saat bekerja di Kantor Paten Swiss di Bern (1902–1909). Tetapi, ia kemudian menyadari bahwa prinsip relativitas juga dapat diperluas cakupannya pada medan gravitasi, dan ia menerbitkan sebuah makalah mengenai relativitas umum pada tahun 1916 dengan teorinya tentang gravitasi. Einstein terus meneliti masalah mekanika statistika dan teori kuantum, yang mengarah pada penjelasannya mengenai teori partikel dan gerak molekul. Einstein juga meneliti kandungan termal cahaya yang meletakkan dasar bagi teori foton cahaya. Pada tahun 1917, ia menerapkan teori relativitas umum untuk memodelkan struktur alam semesta.[11][12]
</p><p>
</p><p>Setelah menghabiskan waktu satu tahun di Praha, Einstein tinggal di Swiss antara tahun 1895 dan 1914, melepas kewarganegaraan Jermannya pada tahun 1896, dan lulus sarjana dari sekolah politeknik federal Swiss (kelak Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) di Zürich pada tahun 1900. Setelah hidup tanpa kewarganegaraan selama lebih dari lima tahun, Einstein memperoleh kewarganegaraan Swiss pada tahun 1901, yang tetap ia pegang sampai akhir hayatnya. Pada tahun 1905, ia dianugerahi gelar PhD oleh Universitas Zurich. Pada tahun yang sama, Einstein menerbitkan empat makalah terobosan pada masa annus mirabilis (tahun mukjizat), yang menghantarkannya memasuki dunia akademis pada usia 26 tahun. Einstein mengajar fisika teoretis di Zurich dari tahun 1912 sampai 1914, kemudian pindah ke Berlin dan menjadi anggota Akademi Sains Prusia.
</p><p>
</p><p>Pada tahun 1933, ketika Einstein mengunjungi Amerika Serikat, Adolf Hitler berkuasa. Karena latar belakang Yahudinya, Einstein memilih tidak kembali ke Jerman.[13] Ia menetap di Amerika Serikat dan menjadi warga negara Amerika pada tahun 1940.[14] Menjelang Perang Dunia II, Einstein mengirim surat kepada Presiden Franklin D. Roosevelt, yang memperingatkannya mengenai potensi pengembangan "bom jenis baru yang sangat dahsyat" dan menyarankan agar AS segera memulai penelitian serupa. Sarannya ini pada akhirnya mengarah pada Proyek Manhattan. Einstein mendukung Sekutu, tetapi menentang gagasan penggunaan fisi nuklir sebagai senjata. Einstein menandatangani Manifesto Russell–Einstein bersama filsuf Britania Raya Bertrand Russell, yang menyoroti dan mengecam bahaya senjata nuklir. Ia mengabdi di Institute for Advanced Study di Princeton, New Jersey, hingga kematiannya pada tahun 1955.
</p><p>
</p><p>Einstein menerbitkan lebih dari 300 makalah ilmiah dan lebih dari 150 karya nonilmiah.[11][15] Prestasi intelektual dan orisinalitasnya menjadikan kata "Einstein" identik dengan "genius".[16] Menurut Eugene Wigner, "pemahaman Einstein lebih dalam dari Jancsi von Neumann. Pikirannya lebih tajam dan lebih orisinal daripada von Neumann. Dan itu adalah pemikiran yang sangat luar biasa."[17]</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>maaf kalau salah</p><br />

                            37. The Grand Mosque of Buntet PesantrenThe Grand Mosque of Buntet Pesantren or also known as Masjid Agung Buntet Pesantren is probably one of the oldest Mosques in Cirebon. It is also the most popular landmark in Buntet Pesantren, an Islamic boarding institution located in Kabupaten Cirebon, West Java.Built in the era of Kyai Abdul Jamil 18421919 the mosque has unique characteristics. One of the interesting thing about the mosque is the rooftop. Unlike many other mosques, there is no dome on top of this mosque. Instead, the rooftop resembles the one which is usually found on a Hindu temple. This is similar to some older mosques across the Java island such as the Grand Mosque of Demak. It is believed to be the acculturation of the Islamic and Hindu architecture.Getting to the mosque, there are five staircases that symbolize the five pillars of Islam. Entering the mosque, there are nine doors which lead to the inner part of the mosque. The number is believed to symbolize the number of the Islamic saints (wali) who helped spread Islam across the archipelago. On the sides of the mosque, there are two rooms, one on each side. This symbolizes the two Islamic creeds or syahadat. Although this mosque has gone through several times of renovations, the original architecture remains the same.PERTANYAAN!give examples from the text for the following linguistic features:1. simple present text2. adjective3. noun or noun phrase4. passive voice​​</h2><br />

THE ANGELS
 Allah has created everything whether physical or spiritual beings. The angels are spiritual beings created by Allah. The angels are the creation of Allah, they are not His partners. They are His servants created from light. Because the angels are spiritual beings, they are invisible. The
angels always obey the commands of Allah and carry out His orders. There are different angels who are engaged in different duties. Some are engaged in keeping records of all our actions; some others brought the message of God to the prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h.). The famous
angels constantly occupied in carrying out Allah's order are Gabriel, lzrail, Israfil and Mikael (Michael). Belief in Angels is one of the pillars of Islamic faith. We have to believe in the angels and it is a part of our belief as Moslems. The prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h.) was given the power to see and to talk with the angel Gabriel.

                            39. Limestone caves can be spectacular structures filled with giant stalactites and stalagmites. These caves are formed when rainwater, which is a weak acid, dissolves calcite, or lime, out of limestone. Over time, the lime-laden water drips down into cracks, enlarging them into caves. Some of the lime is then redeposited to form stalactites and stalagmites. Stalactites, which grow down from cave ceilings, are formed in limestone caves when groundwater containing dissolved lime drips from the roof of the cave and leaves a thin deposit as it evaporates. Stalactites generally grow only a fraction of an inch each year, but over time a considerable number may grow to be several yards long. In cases where the supply of water is seasonal, they may actually have growth rings resembling those on tree trunks that indicate how old the stalactites are. Stalagmites are formed on the floor of a limestone cave where water containing dissolved lime has dripped either from the cave ceiling or from a stalactite above. They develop in the same way as stalactites, when water containing dissolved limestone evaporates. In some limestone caves with mature limestone development, stalactites and stalagmites grow together, creating limestone pillars that stretch from the cave floor to the cave ceiling. 10. It is indicated in paragraph 1 that all of the following are part of the process of forming limestone caves EXCEPT that (A) rainwater dissolves lime from limestone (B) the lime-filled water seeps into breaks in the ground (C) the lime in the water evaporates (D) the cracks in the ground develop into caves 11. According to paragraph 2, it is NOT true that stalactites (A) enlarge cave ceilings (B) are found in limestone caves (C) grow in a downward direction (D) grow quite slowly 12. It is NOT mentioned in paragraph 2 (A) how long stalactites may grow (B) how the age of the stalactite is determined (C) what one of the effects of a limited water supply is (D) what causes stalactites to disappear 13. According to paragraph 3, stalagmites are NOT formed (A) on cave floors (B) from lime dissolved in water (C) above stalactites (D) as water containing lime evaporates14. It is NOT indicated in paragraph 3 that limestone pillars (A) result when a stalactite and a stalagmite grow together (B) are attached to both the floor and the ceiling of a cave (C) are relatively aged limestone formations (D) are more durable than stalactites and stalagmitesmohon dibantu terimakasih ​</h2><br />
