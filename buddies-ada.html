Then, identify the structure!29 Agu 2023 08.26Lionel MessiLuis Lionel Andres Messi was bom on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina. Messi is an Argentinian soccer player who plays forward for the FC Barcelona club and the Argentina national team. He wears number 10 shirt for FC Barcelona and Argentina. He has been universally recognized as the best soccer player in the world. His quick dribbling skills and elusive tricks on the ball put him in a class of his own.Even though his height is only 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 67 kilograms, Messi is strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. He has naturally left-footed, quick, and precise in control of the ball. Considering his short stature and vulnerability, he probably hits the ground less than any other forward in professional football.Messi loves the ball so much. He will scarcely let of it or allow anyone to take it from himwithout a desperate chase to regain possession. As evidenced when playing Real Madrid andother sides that try to break him down with their physicality, the playmaker is also incrediblyunwilling to go down after a challenge if he can stay on his feet.Messi may not appear to be the fastest player on the pitch at times. In fact, his lethargic style when running off the ball makes him look quite slow when compared to fearsome sprinters like Cristiano Ronaldo and Theo Walcott. However, Messi's speed with the ball is probably unparalled in the game. Although he usually only illustrates his pace when he is on the ball looking to take on defenders, he is equally quick when spotting an oncoming pass and running onto it within the 18-yard box.Messi is an agile player. Much like his speed, his agility is best on display when on a magical run through a maze of onrushing defenders. His low center of gravity and fantastic control of the ball allow him to turn his waist in the speediest of motions to deceive opponents attempting to strip the ball from him. Messi's fantastic ability to wait until the very last moment to elude opposing defenders has been so frustrating that USA national team centre-back Jay DeMerit tweeted after a friendly match in 2011, "Chasing Messi around feels like when you're 12 years old playing football with your 16 year old-brother and his buddies."Messi is an intelligent player. He is unique for his blend of intelligence and perceptiveness as both a creator and scorer of goals. His decision-making between passing and shooting is especially clear in cases of an onrushing goalkeeper. When most forwards would have simply shot low and straight at the keeper, he manages exactly the type of finish that has and willcontinue to dazzle audiences around the world for years to come.​</a>

Elsa?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play!
I never see you anymore, come out the door
It's like you've gone away
We used to be best buddies, and now we're not
I wish you would tell me why Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
(Go away, Anna!)
Okay, bye
[Young Anna]
Do you wanna build a snowman
Or ride our bikes around the halls? I think some company is overdue, I've started talking to
The pictures on the walls Hang in there, Joan
It gets a little lonely, all these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)

Elsa?
Please, I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say "have courage" and I'm trying to I'm right out here for you
Just let me in
We only have each other, it's just you and me
What are we gonna do?
Do you wanna build a snowman?</a>

                                            Lionel MessiLuis Lionel Andres Messi was born on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina. Messi isan Argentinian soccer player who plays forward for the FC Barcelona club and the Argentinanational team. He wears number 10 shirt for FC Barcelona and Argentina. He has beenuniversally recognized as the best soccer player in the world. His quick dribbling skills andelusive tricks on the ball put him in a class of his own.Even though his height is only 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 67 kilograms, Messi isstrong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. He has naturally left-footed, quick, and precisein control of the ball. Considering his short stature and vulnerability, he probably hits the groundless than any other forward in professional football.Messi loves the ball so much. He will scarcely let of it or allow anyone to take it from himwithout a desperate chase to regain possession. As evidenced when playing Real Madrid andother sides that try to break him down with their physicality, the playmaker is also incrediblyunwilling to go down after a challenge if he can stay on his feet.Messi may not appear to be the fastest player on the pitch at times. In fact, his lethargicstyle when running off the ball makes him look quite slow when compared to fearsome sprinterslike Cristiano Ronaldo and Theo Walcott. However, Messi's speed with the ball is probablyunparalled in the game. Although he usually only illustrates his pace when he is on the balllooking to take on defenders, he is equally quick when spotting an oncoming pass and runningonto it within the 18-yard box.Messi is an agile player. Much like his speed, his agility is best on display when on amagical run through a maze of onrushing defenders. His low center of gravity and fantasticcontrol of the ball allow him to turn his waist in the speediest of motions to deceive opponentsattempting to strip the ball from him. Messi's fantastic ability to wait until the very last momentto elude opposing defenders has been so frustrating that USA national team centre-back JayDeMerit tweeted after a friendly match in 2011, "Chasing Messi around feels like when you're12 years old playing football with your 16 year old-brother and his buddies."Messi is an intelligent player. He is unique for his blend of intelligence and perceptivenessas both a creator and scorer of goals. His decision-making between passing and shooting isespecially clear in cases of an onrushing goalkeeper. When most forwards would have simplyshot low and straight at the keeper, he manages exactly the type of finish that has and willcontinue to dazzle audiences around the world for years to come..bantu dong KK makasiiii bangettt​</a>

We have not met each other for a long time. I really miss you.Though I look forward to the festve season, I feel a onge of sadness because you are not with me. Ourchildhood was the warmest Remember how we first met at the canteen and then got to know each other? Asbuddies, we counted on each other for everything. We shared lunches, clothes, joy and even grief. Remember homwe studied in the fast food restaurants, sposing questions and sharing ansters!Of course, tre had our share of quarrels. Why did we let matters like boxfriends come benveen us? Rememberhot we both felt head over heels in love with the OSIS prefect? However, we soon made up when we realized thatneither of us meant anything to our high and maghry hero.Well, that's all nice experience that I will never forget forever.Cheers.Nadia​</a>

                                            3. Read the following text carefully! Then, identify the structure! Lionel Messi Luis Lionel Andres Messi was born on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina. Messi is an Argentinian soccer player who plays forward for the FC Barcelona club and the Argentina national team. He wears number 10 shirt for FC Barcelona and Argentina. He has been universally recognized as the best soccer player in the world. His quick dribbling skills and elusive tricks on the ball put him in a class of his own. Even though his height is only 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 67 kilograms, Messi is strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. He has naturally left-footed, quick, and precise in control of the ball. Considering his short stature and vulnerability, he probably hits the ground less than any other forward in professional football. Messi loves the ball so much. He will scarcely let of it or allow anyone to take it from him without a desperate chase to regain possession. As evidenced when playing Real Madrid and other sides that try to break him down with their physicality, the playmaker is also incredibly unwilling to go down after a challenge if he can stay on his feet. Messi may not appear to be the fastest player on the pitch at times. In fact, his lethargic style when running off the ball makes him look quite slow when compared to fearsome sprinters like Cristiano Ronaldo and Theo Walcott. However, Messi's speed with the ball is probably unparalled in the game. Although he usually only illustrates his pace when he is on the ball looking to take on defenders, he is equally quick when spotting an oncoming pass and running onto it within the 18-yard box. Messi is an agile player. Much like his speed, his agility is best on display when on a magical run through a maze of onrushing defenders. His low center of gravity and fantastic control of the ball allow him to turn his waist in the speediest of motions to deceive opponents attempting to strip the ball from him. Messi's fantastic ability to wait until the very last moment to elude opposing defenders has been so frustrating that USA national team centre-back Jay DeMerit tweeted after a friendly match in 2011, "Chasing Messi around feels like when you're 12 years old playing football with your 16 year old-brother and his buddies." Messi is an intelligent player. He is unique for his blend of intelligence and perceptiveness as both a creator and scorer of goals. His decision-making between passing and shooting is especially clear in cases of an onrushing goalkeeper. When most forwards would have simply shot low and straight at the keeper, he manages exactly the type of finish that has and will continue to dazzle audiences around the world for years to come.

                                            As the teacher brought the class back from the washroom, he noticed that Alvin and Elijah were nowhere to be seen. He asked the class, "Has anyone seen Alvin or Elijah?" Most of the students confirmed that they had not seen them, except for Rodney, who remained silent while tapping his foot on the floor anxiously. The teacher noticed this. "Rodney, do you happen to know where your best buddies Alvin and Elijah went?" Rodney looked away and said, "Nah, I haven't seen them." The teacher notified the office of the missing students. An announcement was made over the PA system and a few minutes later, Alvin and Elijah returned to class. Both of them were very sweaty and Elijah was carrying a basketball. "Sorry we took so long. We had to use the bathroom," said Elijah. "Yeah," chimed in Alvin, "it took longer than we thought."

                                            The first thing Carroll William Braxton remembers about June of 1943 is the heat. It was hot in Manassas, Virginia when he and two buddies caught a train to Quantico, and then another to Jacksonville, North Carolina. Braxton was 18, and as WW II engulfed (1) more of America’s mental and physical bandwidth, he didn’t want to wait to be drafted (2). He wanted one of those sharp, blue uniforms sported by United States Marines. Then came the scorching abuse (3). “They made us line up and empty our pockets, and shouted, ‘We don't want those knives in here,’ I guess they thought we always had knives, you know," Braxton says. "And I remember I was wearing a hat, and this MP threw it on the ground and stomped (4) on it. And he proceeded (5) to call me every kind of “n----r’ you can think of, and it seems like he was never going to stop.” The 98-year-old's shared memory of this experience comes in late August while he’s seated (6) in what was once the mess hall for recruits at the former Montford Point Marines Training Camp. Established in 1942, the building was decommissioned (7) in 1949 and is now part of a museum honoring the service of approximately 20,000 men who became the first Black recruits in the U.S. Marines Corps. On this recent summer day, Braxton and four other original Montford Point Marines donned (8) their blue woolen jackets adorned (9) with ribbons and medals, and blue hats with red piping (10) and gold lettering (11). They sat in the first row of metal folding chairs. Some gripped (12) canes, others needed no assistance to stand at attention. All now in their mid to late-90’s, they were joined by the families of 11 other men who had trained at what is now known as Camp Johnson, a satellite school for the nearby Camp Lejeune. During the 57th annual convention of the National Montford Point Marine Association, Inc., family members received bronze replicas of the Congressional Gold Medal that was originally awarded to those history-making recruits in 2012. But 80 years after the Montford Point Camp was carved out of a swampy woody (13) 1,600-acre peninsula near Jacksonville, many of those who followed those recruits are in a race against time. They want more men like Braxton to know that their service is lauded (14) in the same vein (15) as the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, the Buffalo Soldiers, or the Tuskeegee Airmen, aka the “Red Tails.” (Source: nationalgeographic.com) There are 15 uncommon words / phrases.

Messi is an Argentinian soccer player who plays forward for the FC Barcelona club and the Argentina national team. He wears number 10 shirt for FC Barcelona and Argentina. He has been universally recognized as the best soccer player in the world. His quick dribbling skills and elusive tricks on the ball put him in a class of his own.Even though his height is only 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 67 kilograms, Messi is strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. He has naturally left-footed, quick, and precise in control of the ball. Considering his short stature and vulnerability, he probably hits the ground less than any other forward in professional football.Messi loves the ball so much. He will scarcely let of it or allow anyone to take it from himwithout a desperate chase to regain possession. As evidenced when playing Real Madrid andother sides that try to break him down with their physicality, the playmaker is also incrediblyunwilling to go down after a challenge if he can stay on his feet.Messi may not appear to be the fastest player on the pitch at times. In fact, his lethargic style when running off the ball makes him look quite slow when compared to fearsome sprinters like Cristiano Ronaldo and Theo Walcott. However, Messi's speed with the ball is probably unparalled in the game. Although he usually only illustrates his pace when he is on the ball looking to take on defenders, he is equally quick when spotting an oncoming pass and running onto it within the 18-yard box.Messi is an agile player. Much like his speed, his agility is best on display when on a magical run through a maze of onrushing defenders. His low center of gravity and fantastic control of the ball allow him to turn his waist in the speediest of motions to deceive opponents attempting to strip the ball from him. Messi's fantastic ability to wait until the very last moment to elude opposing defenders has been so frustrating that USA national team centre-back Jay DeMerit tweeted after a friendly match in 2011, "Chasing Messi around feels like when you're 12 years old playing football with your 16 year old-brother and his buddies."Messi is an intelligent player. He is unique for his blend of intelligence and perceptiveness as both a creator and scorer of goals. His decision-making between passing and shooting is especially clear in cases of an onrushing goalkeeper. When most forwards would have simply shot low and straight at the keeper, he manages exactly the type of finish that has and willcontinue to dazzle audiences around the world for years to come.​</h2><br />

                            11. Lionel MessiLuis Lionel Andres Messi was born on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina. Messi isan Argentinian soccer player who plays forward for the FC Barcelona club and the Argentinanational team. He wears number 10 shirt for FC Barcelona and Argentina. He has beenuniversally recognized as the best soccer player in the world. His quick dribbling skills andelusive tricks on the ball put him in a class of his own.Even though his height is only 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 67 kilograms, Messi isstrong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. He has naturally left-footed, quick, and precisein control of the ball. Considering his short stature and vulnerability, he probably hits the groundless than any other forward in professional football.Messi loves the ball so much. He will scarcely let of it or allow anyone to take it from himwithout a desperate chase to regain possession. As evidenced when playing Real Madrid andother sides that try to break him down with their physicality, the playmaker is also incrediblyunwilling to go down after a challenge if he can stay on his feet.Messi may not appear to be the fastest player on the pitch at times. In fact, his lethargicstyle when running off the ball makes him look quite slow when compared to fearsome sprinterslike Cristiano Ronaldo and Theo Walcott. However, Messi's speed with the ball is probablyunparalled in the game. Although he usually only illustrates his pace when he is on the balllooking to take on defenders, he is equally quick when spotting an oncoming pass and runningonto it within the 18-yard box.Messi is an agile player. Much like his speed, his agility is best on display when on amagical run through a maze of onrushing defenders. His low center of gravity and fantasticcontrol of the ball allow him to turn his waist in the speediest of motions to deceive opponentsattempting to strip the ball from him. Messi's fantastic ability to wait until the very last momentto elude opposing defenders has been so frustrating that USA national team centre-back JayDeMerit tweeted after a friendly match in 2011, "Chasing Messi around feels like when you're12 years old playing football with your 16 year old-brother and his buddies."Messi is an intelligent player. He is unique for his blend of intelligence and perceptivenessas both a creator and scorer of goals. His decision-making between passing and shooting isespecially clear in cases of an onrushing goalkeeper. When most forwards would have simplyshot low and straight at the keeper, he manages exactly the type of finish that has and willcontinue to dazzle audiences around the world for years to come..bantu dong KK makasiiii bangettt​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Sure, let's identify the main ideas of each paragraph about Lionel Messi:</p><p></p><p>1.

Emphasis on his reputation as the best soccer player in the world due to his quick dribbling skills and elusive tricks on the ball.</p><p></p><p>2. Paragraph 2: Description of Messi's physical attributes, highlighting his strength, balance, and versatility despite being relatively short and lightweight compared to other players in his position.</p><p></p><p>3. Paragraph 3: Messi's love for the ball and his determination to retain possession, even in the face of physical challenges from opponents.</p><p></p><p>4. Paragraph 4: A comparison of Messi's on-ball speed with his off-ball speed, noting that he might not appear fast when not in possession but is unmatched when dribbling and taking on defenders.</p><p></p><p>5. Paragraph 5: Focus on Messi's agility and how he uses it to navigate through defenders with exceptional ball control, making him incredibly difficult to dispossess.</p><p></p><p>6. Paragraph 6: Highlighting Messi's intelligence and decision-making on the field, which sets him apart as both a playmaker and goal scorer, particularly in situations where he faces an onrushing goalkeeper.</p><p></p><p>In summary, the main ideas revolve around Lionel Messi's skills, physical attributes, love for the ball, on-ball speed, agility, and intelligence as a player.</p><br />

                            22. 3. Read the following text carefully! Then, identify the structure! Lionel Messi Luis Lionel Andres Messi was born on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina. Messi is an Argentinian soccer player who plays forward for the FC Barcelona club and the Argentina national team. He wears number 10 shirt for FC Barcelona and Argentina. He has been universally recognized as the best soccer player in the world. His quick dribbling skills and elusive tricks on the ball put him in a class of his own. Even though his height is only 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 67 kilograms, Messi is strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. He has naturally left-footed, quick, and precise in control of the ball. Considering his short stature and vulnerability, he probably hits the ground less than any other forward in professional football. Messi loves the ball so much. He will scarcely let of it or allow anyone to take it from him without a desperate chase to regain possession. As evidenced when playing Real Madrid and other sides that try to break him down with their physicality, the playmaker is also incredibly unwilling to go down after a challenge if he can stay on his feet. Messi may not appear to be the fastest player on the pitch at times. In fact, his lethargic style when running off the ball makes him look quite slow when compared to fearsome sprinters like Cristiano Ronaldo and Theo Walcott. However, Messi's speed with the ball is probably unparalled in the game.

Messi's fantastic ability to wait until the very last moment to elude opposing defenders has been so frustrating that USA national team centre-back Jay DeMerit tweeted after a friendly match in 2011, "Chasing Messi around feels like when you're 12 years old playing football with your 16 year old-brother and his buddies." Messi is an intelligent player. He is unique for his blend of intelligence and perceptiveness as both a creator and scorer of goals. His decision-making between passing and shooting is especially clear in cases of an onrushing goalkeeper. When most forwards would have simply shot low and straight at the keeper, he manages exactly the type of finish that has and will continue to dazzle audiences around the world for years to come.

                            25. As the teacher brought the class back from the washroom, he noticed that Alvin and Elijah were nowhere to be seen. He asked the class, "Has anyone seen Alvin or Elijah?" Most of the students confirmed that they had not seen them, except for Rodney, who remained silent while tapping his foot on the floor anxiously. The teacher noticed this. "Rodney, do you happen to know where your best buddies Alvin and Elijah went?" Rodney looked away and said, "Nah, I haven't seen them." The teacher notified the office of the missing students. An announcement was made over the PA system and a few minutes later, Alvin and Elijah returned to class. Both of them were very sweaty and Elijah was carrying a basketball. "Sorry we took so long. We had to use the bathroom," said Elijah. "Yeah," chimed in Alvin, "it took longer than we thought."
 1. What were Alvin and Elijah doing while they were gone?
 2. Why was Rodney acting so strangely?
 3. Will the teacher believe Alvin and Elijah's story</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong>. They lied about using the bathroom. Both of them were very sweaty and Elijah was carrying a basketball, so they must be <strong>playing basketball</strong> while they were gone.</p><p><strong>2. Rodney was acting strangely because he knew where Alvin and Elijah went</strong>. He just didn't want to tell the teacher.</p><p><strong>3. No, he will not.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

                            26. The first thing Carroll William Braxton remembers about June of 1943 is the heat. It was hot in Manassas, Virginia when he and two buddies caught a train to Quantico, and then another to Jacksonville, North Carolina. Braxton was 18, and as WW II engulfed (1) more of America’s mental and physical bandwidth, he didn’t want to wait to be drafted (2). He wanted one of those sharp, blue uniforms sported by United States Marines. Then came the scorching abuse (3). “They made us line up and empty our pockets, and shouted, ‘We don't want those knives in here,’ I guess they thought we always had knives, you know," Braxton says. "And I remember I was wearing a hat, and this MP threw it on the ground and stomped (4) on it. And he proceeded (5) to call me every kind of “n----r’ you can think of, and it seems like he was never going to stop.” The 98-year-old's shared memory of this experience comes in late August while he’s seated (6) in what was once the mess hall for recruits at the former Montford Point Marines Training Camp. Established in 1942, the building was decommissioned (7) in 1949 and is now part of a museum honoring the service of approximately 20,000 men who became the first Black recruits in the U.S. Marines Corps. On this recent summer day, Braxton and four other original Montford Point Marines donned (8) their blue woolen jackets adorned (9) with ribbons and medals, and blue hats with red piping (10) and gold lettering (11). They sat in the first row of metal folding chairs. Some gripped (12) canes, others needed no assistance to stand at attention. All now in their mid to late-90’s, they were joined by the families of 11 other men who had trained at what is now known as Camp Johnson, a satellite school for the nearby Camp Lejeune. During the 57th annual convention of the National Montford Point Marine Association, Inc., family members received bronze replicas of the Congressional Gold Medal that was originally awarded to those history-making recruits in 2012. But 80 years after the Montford Point Camp was carved out of a swampy woody (13) 1,600-acre peninsula near Jacksonville, many of those who followed those recruits are in a race against time. They want more men like Braxton to know that their service is lauded (14) in the same vein (15) as the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, the Buffalo Soldiers, or the Tuskeegee Airmen, aka the “Red Tails.” (Source: nationalgeographic.com) There are 15 uncommon words / phrases. Would you like to find the meaning in English. What is the topic of each paragrap​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Hal pertama yang diingat Carroll William Braxton tentang Juni 1943 adalah panasnya. Itu panas di Manassas, Virginia ketika dia dan dua temannya naik kereta ke Quantico, dan kemudian ke Jacksonville, North Carolina. Braxton berusia 18 tahun, dan saat PD II menelan (1) lebih banyak bandwidth mental dan fisik Amerika, dia tidak ingin menunggu untuk direkrut (2). Dia menginginkan salah satu seragam biru tajam yang dikenakan oleh Marinir Amerika Serikat. Kemudian datanglah siksaan yang membakar (3). "Mereka menyuruh kami berbaris dan mengosongkan kantong kami, dan berteriak, 'Kami tidak ingin pisau itu ada di sini,' saya kira mereka mengira kami selalu punya pisau, Anda tahu," kata Braxton. "Dan saya ingat saya memakai topi, dan MP ini melemparkannya ke tanah dan menginjak (4) di atasnya. Dan dia melanjutkan (5) untuk memanggil saya setiap jenis "n----r' yang dapat Anda pikirkan, dan sepertinya dia tidak akan pernah berhenti." Kenangan bersama pria berusia 98 tahun tentang pengalaman ini datang pada akhir Agustus saat dia duduk (6) di tempat yang dulunya adalah aula untuk rekrutan di bekas Kamp Pelatihan Marinir Montford Point. Didirikan pada tahun 1942, bangunan ini dinonaktifkan (7) pada tahun 1949 dan sekarang menjadi bagian dari museum yang menghormati layanan sekitar 20.000 pria yang menjadi rekrutan kulit hitam pertama di Korps Marinir AS. Pada hari musim panas baru-baru ini, Braxton dan empat Marinir Montford Point asli lainnya mengenakan (8) jaket wol biru mereka yang dihiasi (9) dengan pita dan medali, dan topi biru dengan pipa merah (10) dan tulisan emas (11). Mereka duduk di baris pertama kursi lipat logam. Beberapa mencengkeram (12) tongkat, yang lain tidak membutuhkan bantuan untuk berdiri tegak. Semua sekarang di pertengahan hingga akhir 90-an, mereka bergabung dengan keluarga dari 11 pria lain yang telah berlatih di tempat yang sekarang dikenal sebagai Camp Johnson, sekolah satelit untuk Camp Lejeune di dekatnya. Selama konvensi tahunan ke-57 dari National Montford Point Marine Association, Inc., anggota keluarga menerima replika perunggu Medali Emas Kongres yang awalnya diberikan kepada rekrutan pembuat sejarah pada tahun 2012. Namun 80 tahun setelah Montford Point Camp diukir dari semenanjung kayu berawa (13) seluas 1.600 hektar di dekat Jacksonville, banyak dari mereka yang mengikuti rekrutan itu berpacu dengan waktu. Mereka ingin lebih banyak pria seperti Braxton mengetahui bahwa layanan mereka dipuji (14) dengan nada yang sama (15) seperti Resimen Infanteri Massachusetts ke-54, Prajurit Kerbau, atau Penerbang Tuskeegee, alias “Ekor Merah”.

                            35. Lionel MessiLuis Lionel Andres Messi was born on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina. Messi isan Argentinian soccer player who plays forward for the FC Barcelona club and the Argentinanational team. He wears number 10 shirt for FC Barcelona and Argentina. He has beenuniversally recognized as the best soccer player in the world. His quick dribbling skills andelusive tricks on the ball put him in a class of his own.Even though his height is only 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 67 kilograms, Messi isstrong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. He has naturally left-footed, quick, and precisein control of the ball. Considering his short stature and vulnerability, he probably hits the groundless than any other forward in professional football.Messi loves the ball so much. He will scarcely let of it or allow anyone to take it from himwithout a desperate chase to regain possession. As evidenced when playing Real Madrid andother sides that try to break him down with their physicality, the playmaker is also incrediblyunwilling to go down after a challenge if he can stay on his feet.Messi may not appear to be the fastest player on the pitch at times. In fact, his lethargicstyle when running off the ball makes him look quite slow when compared to fearsome sprinterslike Cristiano Ronaldo and Theo Walcott. However, Messi's speed with the ball is probablyunparalled in the game. Although he usually only illustrates his pace when he is on the balllooking to take on defenders, he is equally quick when spotting an oncoming pass and runningonto it within the 18-yard box.Messi is an agile player. Much like his speed, his agility is best on display when on amagical run through a maze of onrushing defenders. His low center of gravity and fantasticcontrol of the ball allow him to turn his waist in the speediest of motions to deceive opponentsattempting to strip the ball from him. Messi's fantastic ability to wait until the very last momentto elude opposing defenders has been so frustrating that USA national team centre-back JayDeMerit tweeted after a friendly match in 2011, "Chasing Messi around feels like when you're12 years old playing football with your 16 year old-brother and his buddies."Messi is an intelligent player. He is unique for his blend of intelligence and perceptivenessas both a creator and scorer of goals. His decision-making between passing and shooting isespecially clear in cases of an onrushing goalkeeper. When most forwards would have simplyshot low and straight at the keeper, he manages exactly the type of finish that has and willcontinue to dazzle audiences around the world for years to come..Tolong dong kk, makasiii :)​</h2><br />
