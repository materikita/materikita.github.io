It is very useful because it helps people clean dishes and eating-utensils. In 1887 Josephine Cochrane invented the first dishwasher. She made the machine because her servants often broke her lovely ceramic dishes. Since then dishwashers have continuously improved until today. Modern dishwashers are made of stainless steel and consists of a front drawing-door for loading dishes, a wire rack for the dirty crockery, a rotating sprayer and a drying element. The standard width and depth is 60 cm or 24 inches in Europe and in the US. Dishwashers clean the dirt from the dishes by spraying hot water, typically between 550 and 75° C. The water is mixed with detergent. Then the mixture is pumped by rotating spray arms which spray it onto the dishes. When the washing processes finishes, the water is drained and more hot water is pumped in for a rinsing process. The final process is to heat the dishes to dry them. The whole process needs 15 to 20 minutes 4. A text that provides information about something is called?A. ReportB. Description C. Historical RecountD. Procedure​</a>

Durians have round or oval shape with green or yellowish thick rind and weigh between 2,8to 3,5 kg. each durian has large seed about 3,5 cm in length. The fruit needs three months to ripen andfall to the ground. The seed can be cooked by roasting, frying, and boiling. The tasty part of the durianis the foul-smelling, custard-like pulp. Cakes, ice cream, and other food topping have this flavor. The odorof ripe durians can even attract wild animals, such as elephants, tigers, and rhinoceroses.1.

Thanks to his struggle and hard work, Eko Yuli Irawan is now one of the best weightlifters in Indonesia.

Adults weigh from 60 – 120 pounds ( 27 – 55 kg ). Males are larger than females.    Snow Leopards have dark rosettes on a creamy white background, camouflaging them in the snow and rocks.

It is very useful because it helps people clean dishes and eating-utensils. In 1887 Josephine Cochrane invented the first dishwasher. She made the machine because her servants often broke her lovely ceramic dishes. Since then dishwashers have continuously improved until today. Modern dishwashers are made of stainless steel and consists of a front drawing-door for loading dishes, a wire rack for the dirty crockery, a rotating sprayer and a drying element. The standard width and depth is 60 cm or 24 inches in Europe and in the US. Dishwashers clean the dirt from the dishes by spraying hot water, typically between 550 and 75° C. The water is mixed with detergent. Then the mixture is pumped by rotating spray arms which spray it onto the dishes. When the washing processes finishes, the water is drained and more hot water is pumped in for a rinsing process. The final process is to heat the dishes to dry them. The whole process needs 15 to 20 minutes 4. A text that provides information about something is called?A. ReportB. Description C. Historical RecountD. Procedure​</h2><br />

Durians have round or oval shape with green or yellowish thick rind and weigh between 2,8to 3,5 kg. each durian has large seed about 3,5 cm in length. The fruit needs three months to ripen andfall to the ground. The seed can be cooked by roasting, frying, and boiling. The tasty part of the durianis the foul-smelling, custard-like pulp.

Snow Leopards are in danger of extinction due to loss of habits, loss of prey and over hunting; few Snow Leopard are left in the wild.    Snow Leopards are fast runners, good swimmers and excellent climbers. They often hide their food on trees. The Leopard’s call sounds like a raspy couch, not a roar. Leopards live up to 21 in capacity.    These graceful, medium-sized cats grow to be about 3,5 feet ( 1 m ) long; the tail is about 3 feet (0,9 ) long. Adults weigh from 60 – 120 pounds ( 27 – 55 kg ). Males are larger than females.    Snow Leopards have dark rosettes on a creamy white background, camouflaging them in the snow and rocks. Cubs are grey they are born; there are 2-3 cubs in each litter.    These large cats are carnivores that hunt mostly at dusk and at dawn; they are nocturnal.1.	What kinds of the text belong to…a.

The tower has become a global icon of France and is one of the most recognizable structures in the world.	The Parisian landmark is the tallest structure in Paris and one of the most recognized structures in the world and is named after its designer, engineer Gustave Eiffel. 6,719,200 people visited the tower in 2006 and more than 200,000,000 since its construction. This makes the tower the most visited paid monument in the world. Including the 24 m (79 ft) antenna, the structure is 325 m (1,063 ft) high (since 2000), which is equivalent to about 81 levels in a conventional building.	When the tower was completed in 1889 it replaced the Washington Monument as the world’s tallest structure – a title it retained until 1930 when New York City’s Chrysler Building (319 m – 1,047 ft tall) was completed. The tower is now the fifth-tallest structure in France and the tallest structure in Paris, with the second-tallest being the Tour Montparnasse (210 m-689 ft), although that will soon be surpassed by Tour AXA (225.11 m-738.36 ft)	The structure of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tons. Depending on the ambient temperature the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18 cm (7 in) due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun. the tower also sways 6-7 cm (2-3 in) in the wind.3.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>(a) Dalam 1 putaran penuh jam, jarum menit akan bergerak mengelilingi lingkaran dengan jari-jari 12 cm. Keliling lingkaran tersebut dapat dihitung dengan rumus C = 2πr, di mana r adalah jari-jari lingkaran dan π adalah konstanta pi (sekitar 3.14). Maka, keliling lingkaran tersebut adalah:</p><p></p><p>C = 2πr = 2π(12 cm) ≈ 75.4 cm</p><p></p><p>Jadi, dalam 1 putaran penuh jam, ujung jarum menit akan bergerak sejauh 75.4 cm. Dalam 25 menit, jarum menit akan bergerak sejauh 25/60 kali putaran penuh jam, atau sekitar 31.4% dari keliling lingkaran. Jadi, jarak yang ditempuh oleh ujung jarum menit dalam 25 menit adalah sekitar:</p><p></p><p>31.4% x 75.4 cm ≈ 23.7 cm</p><p></p><p>Jadi, ujung jarum menit akan bergerak sejauh sekitar 23.7 cm dalam 25 menit.</p><p></p><p>(b) Jarak total yang harus ditempuh oleh ujung jarum menit agar bergerak sejauh 24 cm adalah 24 cm. Dalam 1 putaran penuh jam, ujung jarum menit akan bergerak sejauh 75.4 cm. Oleh karena itu, ujung jarum menit harus berputar sebanyak 24/75.4 putaran penuh jam. Maka waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk bergerak sejauh 24 cm adalah:</p><p></p><p>(24/75.4) x 60 menit ≈ 19 menit</p><p></p><p>Jadi, waktu yang dibutuhkan oleh ujung jarum menit untuk bergerak sejauh 24 cm adalah sekitar 19 menit.</p><br />

                            36. Diagram 5 shows a hemispheric-shaped wok containing half the soup and an empty thermos in a cylinder shape. Given that the diameter of the wok and the thermos's food storage are 24 cm and 16 cm, respectively,Mrs. Elly wants to put all the soup in the flask to give to her neighbour. If the height of the flask filled full of soup is 11 cm, will the soup spill out? Justify your answer.[Guna/Use л = 22/7 ][4 marks]​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawab:</strong></p><p>Untuk menentukan apakah sup akan tumpah dari termos atau tidak, pertama-tama dapat dicari volume wok yang terisi sup dan volume termos yang terisi sup. Kemudian, dapat dibandingkan kedua volume tersebut untuk mengetahui apakah termos dapat menampung semua sup yang ada di wok atau tidak.</p><p></p><p>Untuk mencari volume wok, dapat digunakan rumus volume bola, yaitu:</p><p>V = 4/3πr³</p><p></p><p>Dengan r = 12 cm (diameter wok dibagi 2), maka volume wok yang terisi sup adalah:</p><p>V = 4/3π(12)³</p><p>= 4/3π(1728)</p><p>= 4/3(22/7)(1728)</p><p>= 704π/3</p><p>≈ 2238,5 cm³</p><p></p><p>Untuk mencari volume termos yang terisi sup, dapat digunakan rumus volume tabung, yaitu:</p><p>V = πr²h</p><p></p><p>Dengan r = 8 cm (diameter termos dibagi 2) dan h = 11 cm, maka volume termos yang terisi sup adalah:</p><p>V = π(8)²(11)</p><p>= π(64)(11)</p><p>= 704π</p><p>≈ 2238,5 cm³</p><p></p><p>Dari hasil perhitungan di atas, terlihat bahwa volume termos yang terisi sup sama dengan volume wok yang terisi sup. Oleh karena itu, sup tidak akan tumpah dari termos ketika Mrs. Elly menaruh semua sup dari wok ke dalam termos.</p><br />
