                                            Paragraf 1Last week, on my holiday, my family and I decided to go to a city we have never been before. This time, we picked Yogyakarta. From what i knew before i went to the trip, Yogyakarta is a busy city that is filled with culture. It still have a unique government system called the keraton. I also heard that it has a variety of culinary treats that i could try. Long before the trip, i was already excited to go.Paragraf 2On Sunday morning, i arrived at Yogyakarta and went straight to my hotel which was located near the Malioboro street. After that my family and i went straight to Keraton Yogyakarta. It was a white, big building that stands near the town square. To get there, we went with a rented car. There were a lot of stalls that sells crafts there so i bought a t-shirt and five keychain. Then we went into the place with the ticket we have bought. The place was very beautiful. Although the building itself is old, it felt timeless and grand. We studied the history of the place and the people that lived there. Finally, we went out and ate in the nearby restaurant. The rest of the Sunday was spent resting in the hotel so that we have the strength to travel the next day.Paragraf 3.Monday morning arrived with its blue sky and golden sunlight. My father and I ran accross the city in the morning so that we could get to know the city better. After that, we packed our bags to go to Borobudur. It was a long trip but after hours of car ride we finally arrived there. The place was clean and very spacious. From afar, we can already see the Borobudur temple from far away because it is so big. My family climbed hundreds of steps to reach the top. By the time we reached the top, it was already four o’clock in the evening. I couldn’t believe my eyes because the scenery was so beautiful. The top of the Borobudur temple overlooked the whole city. I could see trees and buildings for miles. With the sunlight, it was even more beautiful. The next days we spent trying the food in Yogyakarta. My favorite was the bakpia which is a kind of local dessert that is filled with a variety of fillings. The filling i like most is the cheese one. Because i loved it so much, i bought two boxes of bakpia. On Thursday morning, i flew back to Jakarta. I was really sad to leave the city because it was the best travel destination so far. I wish i could go back to Yogyakarta now.1. Tentukan masing- masing ide utama dan pendukung dalam setiap paragraf2. Rangkumlah artikel dalam 3 paragraf.​</a>

                                            Once upon a time, there is a princess in West Java named Dayang Sumbi. Dayang Sumbi, she was also beauty, smart, intelligence and clever. She has parents, her parent name is Sugging. She had a son named Sangkuriang. Sangkuriang was a boy who liked to hunt and when hunting, he was always accompanied by his dog named Tumang. Despite a Dog, Tumang actually an incarnation of the god and the father of Sangkuriang.
One day, he got mad at Tumang for not pursuing the animals. Because of so angry, he then expelled Tumang so the dog went into the woods. He then returned to the palace and told the incident to her mother. Dayang Sumbi was so angry and hit his head. Sangkuriang then disappointed and he decided to wander.
After hitting Sangkuriang, Dayang Sumbi felt so sorry and she always prayed and meditated to get forgiveness from God. One day, God gave a gift because she was so diligent in praying. The prize is a timeless beauty that would make Dayang Sumbi becoming young forever.
After wandering for a dozen years, Sangkuriang returned home. When he reached the kingdom, all had changed. He did not know what was happening. One day, he met a girl who was so beautiful. The girl was actually Dayang Sumbi, his own mother.
Sangkurian fell in love with the girl and then proposed her. Because of the handsomeness that was owned by Sangkuriang, then Dayang Sumbi also fell in love. One day, Sangkuriang want to hunt and he asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the headband. However, Dayang Sumbi surprised that her future husband had a head injury. Dayang Sumbi then realized that was the same injury as her son who wandered away. She then noticed Sangkuriang face, and she was more surprised to realize that her husband was Sangkuriang, her own son.
After those happenings, she immediately looked for ways to thwart the plan of making a proposal. She then proposed two requirements to Sangkuriang. First, Sangkuriang should stem the Citarum River. Secondly, she asked Sangkuriang to make a big canoe to cross the river. Both of those conditions should be finished before sunrise.
At night, Sangkuriang asked for help to spirit creatures to complete all the work. Dayang Sumbi secretly peeked at the job. Once the work was almost complete, Dayang Sumbi ordered his forces to hold a very long red carpet to the east of the city.
The carpet made the light became red and Sangkuriang thought that the sun had risen. He stopped his work and was very upset because all could not meet the requirements posed by Dayang Sumbi. Using his strength, Sangkuriang broke the dam and the city became flooding. His big canoe then crashed upside down and changed into a mountain named, Tangkuban Perahu.

                        Octopuses<br />Octopuses are ocean creatures with eight tentacles. Like squids and cuttlefish, octopuses do not have shells or scales, but skin.<br />   Some octopuses live in warm waters, others inhabit cold waters. They may grow up to 9 m and weigh 45-50 kg. Their life spans range from 1 to 2 years.<br />   Strangely, as octopuses breathe, sending water out of the bodies, they move backwards. They also avoid danger and predators this way. Another octopuses' weapon is their toxic saliva, transferred through a bite.<br /><br />Semoga membantu<br />

Gigi komodo hampir seluruhnya dilapisi oleh gusinya. Setelah makan, gusi berdarah, membuat biakan yang sempurna untuk mikroorganisme yang mematikan.

                            16. Paragraf 1Last week, on my holiday, my family and I decided to go to a city we have never been before. This time, we picked Yogyakarta. From what i knew before i went to the trip, Yogyakarta is a busy city that is filled with culture. It still have a unique government system called the keraton. I also heard that it has a variety of culinary treats that i could try. Long before the trip, i was already excited to go.Paragraf 2On Sunday morning, i arrived at Yogyakarta and went straight to my hotel which was located near the Malioboro street. After that my family and i went straight to Keraton Yogyakarta. It was a white, big building that stands near the town square. To get there, we went with a rented car. There were a lot of stalls that sells crafts there so i bought a t-shirt and five keychain. Then we went into the place with the ticket we have bought. The place was very beautiful. Although the building itself is old, it felt timeless and grand. We studied the history of the place and the people that lived there. Finally, we went out and ate in the nearby restaurant. The rest of the Sunday was spent resting in the hotel so that we have the strength to travel the next day.Paragraf 3.Monday morning arrived with its blue sky and golden sunlight. My father and I ran accross the city in the morning so that we could get to know the city better. After that, we packed our bags to go to Borobudur. It was a long trip but after hours of car ride we finally arrived there. The place was clean and very spacious. From afar, we can already see the Borobudur temple from far away because it is so big. My family climbed hundreds of steps to reach the top. By the time we reached the top, it was already four o’clock in the evening. I couldn’t believe my eyes because the scenery was so beautiful. The top of the Borobudur temple overlooked the whole city. I could see trees and buildings for miles. With the sunlight, it was even more beautiful. The next days we spent trying the food in Yogyakarta. My favorite was the bakpia which is a kind of local dessert that is filled with a variety of fillings. The filling i like most is the cheese one. Because i loved it so much, i bought two boxes of bakpia. On Thursday morning, i flew back to Jakarta. I was really sad to leave the city because it was the best travel destination so far. I wish i could go back to Yogyakarta now.1. Tentukan masing- masing ide utama dan pendukung dalam setiap paragraf2. Rangkumlah artikel dalam 3 paragraf.​</h2><br />

Kali ini, kami memilih Yogyakarta.  Dari apa yang saya ketahui sebelum saya pergi ke perjalanan, Yogyakarta</p><p> adalah kota sibuk yang penuh dengan budaya.  Masih memiliki sistem pemerintahan yang unik yang disebut</p><p> keraton.  Saya juga mendengar bahwa ia memiliki beragam suguhan kuliner yang bisa saya coba.  Jauh sebelum perjalanan, saya</p><p> sudah bersemangat untuk pergi.</p><p></p><p> Paragraf 2</p><p> Pada hari Minggu pagi, saya tiba di Yogyakarta dan langsung menuju hotel saya yang dulu</p><p> terletak di dekat jalan Malioboro.  Setelah itu, saya dan keluarga saya langsung pergi ke Keraton</p><p> Yogyakarta.  Itu adalah bangunan putih besar yang berdiri di dekat alun-alun kota.  Untuk sampai di sana, kami pergi</p><p> dengan mobil sewaan.  Ada banyak kios yang menjual kerajinan tangan di sana, jadi saya membeli t-shirt dan lima</p><p> gantungan kunci.  Kemudian kami pergi ke tempat itu dengan tiket yang telah kami beli.  Tempat itu sangat</p><p> Cantik.  Meskipun bangunan itu sendiri sudah tua, rasanya abadi dan megah.  Kami mempelajari sejarah</p><p> tempat dan orang-orang yang tinggal di sana.  Akhirnya, kami keluar dan makan di restoran terdekat.</p><p> Sisa hari Minggu dihabiskan untuk beristirahat di hotel sehingga kami memiliki kekuatan untuk bepergian</p><p> hari berikutnya.</p><p></p><p> Paragraf 3.</p><p> Senin pagi tiba dengan langit biru dan sinar matahari keemasan.  Ayah saya dan saya berlari</p><p> melintasi kota di pagi hari sehingga kami bisa mengenal kota lebih baik.  Setelah itu, kami berkemas</p><p> tas kami untuk pergi ke Borobudur.  Itu adalah perjalanan yang panjang tetapi setelah beberapa jam perjalanan dengan mobil, kami akhirnya tiba di sana.</p><p> Tempat itu bersih dan sangat luas.  Dari kejauhan, kita sudah bisa melihat candi Borobudur</p><p> dari jauh karena sangat besar.  Keluarga saya menaiki ratusan anak tangga untuk mencapai puncak.  Oleh</p><p> Saat kami mencapai puncak, sudah jam empat sore.  Saya tidak bisa mempercayai mata saya</p><p> karena pemandangannya begitu indah.  Bagian atas candi Borobudur menghadap ke keseluruhan</p><p> kota.  Saya bisa melihat pohon dan bangunan berkilo-kilometer.  Dengan sinar matahari, itu bahkan lebih indah.</p><p> Hari-hari berikutnya kami menghabiskan waktu mencoba makanan di Yogyakarta.  Favorit saya adalah bakpia yang merupakan</p><p> jenis makanan penutup lokal yang diisi dengan berbagai tambalan.  Isi yang paling saya sukai adalah keju</p><p> satu.  Karena saya sangat menyukainya, saya membeli dua kotak bakpia.  Pada hari Kamis pagi, saya terbang</p><p> kembali ke Jakarta.  Saya benar-benar sedih meninggalkan kota karena itu adalah tujuan perjalanan terbaik sejauh ini.</p><p> Saya berharap saya bisa kembali ke Yogyakarta sekarang.</p><p></p><p> 1.

                            28. Once upon a time, there is a princess in West Java named Dayang Sumbi. Dayang Sumbi, she was also beauty, smart, intelligence and clever. She has parents, her parent name is Sugging. She had a son named Sangkuriang. Sangkuriang was a boy who liked to hunt and when hunting, he was always accompanied by his dog named Tumang. Despite a Dog, Tumang actually an incarnation of the god and the father of Sangkuriang.
One day, he got mad at Tumang for not pursuing the animals. Because of so angry, he then expelled Tumang so the dog went into the woods. He then returned to the palace and told the incident to her mother. Dayang Sumbi was so angry and hit his head. Sangkuriang then disappointed and he decided to wander.
After hitting Sangkuriang, Dayang Sumbi felt so sorry and she always prayed and meditated to get forgiveness from God. One day, God gave a gift because she was so diligent in praying. The prize is a timeless beauty that would make Dayang Sumbi becoming young forever.
After wandering for a dozen years, Sangkuriang returned home. When he reached the kingdom, all had changed. He did not know what was happening. One day, he met a girl who was so beautiful. The girl was actually Dayang Sumbi, his own mother.
Sangkurian fell in love with the girl and then proposed her. Because of the handsomeness that was owned by Sangkuriang, then Dayang Sumbi also fell in love. One day, Sangkuriang want to hunt and he asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the headband. However, Dayang Sumbi surprised that her future husband had a head injury. Dayang Sumbi then realized that was the same injury as her son who wandered away. She then noticed Sangkuriang face, and she was more surprised to realize that her husband was Sangkuriang, her own son.
After those happenings, she immediately looked for ways to thwart the plan of making a proposal. She then proposed two requirements to Sangkuriang. First, Sangkuriang should stem the Citarum River. Secondly, she asked Sangkuriang to make a big canoe to cross the river. Both of those conditions should be finished before sunrise.
At night, Sangkuriang asked for help to spirit creatures to complete all the work. Dayang Sumbi secretly peeked at the job. Once the work was almost complete, Dayang Sumbi ordered his forces to hold a very long red carpet to the east of the city.
The carpet made the light became red and Sangkuriang thought that the sun had risen. He stopped his work and was very upset because all could not meet the requirements posed by Dayang Sumbi. Using his strength, Sangkuriang broke the dam and the city became flooding. His big canoe then crashed upside down and changed into a mountain named, Tangkuban Perahu.
