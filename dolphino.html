                       DOLPHINS 
 Dolphins are sea mammals. They are members of Delphinidae family. They have to breathe air or they will die. Dolphins can hold their breath for six minutes. 
   Dolphins have smooth skin. Only baby dolphins are born with a few bristly hairs on their snouts. Their hair soon fall out. They have big tail and the fin on the top of their backs keep the dolphin from rolling over. The female dolphins have a thick layer of fat under their skin to keep the warm when they dive very deep. The dolphin's front fins are called flippers. They use them to turn left and right. Dolphins grow from 2 to 3 meters long and weight up to 75 kilograms. 
   Dolphins hunt together in a group. A group of dolphins is called a pod. They eat fish, shrimps, and small squids. They live in salt water oceans. When dolphins fear or see a ship close by they go near and follow it from distance, dolphins can leap out of the water and do somersaults.Sometimes they invent their own tricks and stunts after watching other dolphins perform.
    Dolphins are very friendly to people and have never harmed anyone. They are very playful animals</a>

                                            For many years, people believed that thecleverest animals after man were the chimpanzees.Now, however, there is a proof that dolphins maybe even cleverer than these big apes.Although a dolphin lives in the sea, it is not afish. It is a mammal. It is in many ways, therefore,like a human being.Dolphins have a simple language. They areable to talk to one another. It may be possible forman to learn how to talk to dolphins. But, this willnot be easy because dolphins cannot hear thekind of sounds man can make. If man wants totalk to dolphins, therefore, he will have to make athird language which both he and the dolphins canunderstand.Dolphins are also very friendly toward man.They often follow ships. There are many storiesabout dolphins guiding ships through difficult anddangerous waters,1. why talking to dolphin is not easy?a. dolphins cannot her the kind of man'sb. dolphins cannot think as human c. dolphins like playing with man d. dolphins feel annoyed by man.2. what is the characteristic of dolphin according to the text?a.

                                            kk tolong bantuin dong kak pliss.Dolphins are mammals in the order Cetacea. They are part of the toothed whales. Generally, they are among the smaller whales. Most live in salt water oceans, but some live in rivers – there are oceanic dolphins and river dolphins. Dolphins are from 1.5 to 4 metres (4.5 ft to 13 ft) long. The Killer whale is the largest of the group, and can be about 8 metres (26 ft).The name 'dolphin' comes from the Ancient Greek δελφίς (delphis) meaning "with a womb", because it was first thought to be a fish with a womb. It is now known to be a mammal, and quite an intelligent mammal. Dolphins breathe air. A dolphin's nose is on top of its head so the dolphin can easily breathe on the surface of the water. The skin of a dolphin has no scales. It is soft and smooth. However, it is very firm, due to how much muscle they have. Dolphins use echolocation to find their food.Dolphins swim in 'pods'; a very large pod is called a herd. They are very social and help each other fight off predators. Dolphins have fought off sharks in this way. They can kill large sharks by ramming them over and over again with their snouts and heads. They look after the young when the mothers that need to leave their calves to hunt for food. The young need to breathe more often than the adults, and the food may be in deeper waters.Oceanic dolphins are marine animals living in the sea. They live in all of the oceans. Three of the four species of river dolphins live in fresh water rivers. The La Plata Dolphin lives in saltwater estuaries and the ocean. Water pollution and the loss of habitat are a threat to some dolphins, especially those living in rivers and estuaries.Dolphins do not sleep in a normal way. They have two sides of their brain, which they use to sleep. One side sleeps, while the other side stays awake. They will keep one eye open to watch for predators while they sleep.Dolphins (and other cetaceans) sleep in the water.[1] There is danger from sharks.[2] While sleeping in water, the animals go through different stages of sleep. They do some behaviours during sleep: they come to the surface occasionally to breathe, and they have an eye open most of the time.[1] The details vary in different species or groups. Predator detection is the obvious function of this behaviour. Similar adaptations are found in pinnipeds like seals.[1]The brain of a dolphin is like a human brain in size and development. Dolphins have reasonable eyesight. They can watch a thing in the water, and they can see colors, too. They can also see in dark places.A dolphin's hearing is better than their sight. There are small holes behind the eyes, and they are the ears of a dolphin. Dolphins can hear a sound underwater. They can know the direction of the sound very well.•Reread the text to answer the next question!1.How many kinds of dolphins are there?mention them !2.Where can you find dolphins nose and dolphins ears?3.How do the dolphins kill sharks?4.why does a dolphin sleep with one eye opens?5.How is the dolphins brain like?6.How are the dolphins eyes while they are sleeping?7.How can dolphins see in dark places?8.Why don't dolphins sleep in a normal way?9.How is a dolphins hearing better than their sight?10.How do the young need to find food?pliss bantuin kak​</a>

   Dolphins have smooth skin. Only baby dolphins are born with a few bristly hairs on their snouts. Their hair soon fall out. They have big tail and the fin on the top of their backs keep the dolphin from rolling over. The female dolphins have a thick layer of fat under their skin to keep the warm when they dive very deep. The dolphin's front fins are called flippers. They use them to turn left and right. Dolphins grow from 2 to 3 meters long and weight up to 75 kilograms. 
   Dolphins hunt together in a group. A group of dolphins is called a pod. They eat fish, shrimps, and small squids. They live in salt water oceans. When dolphins fear or see a ship close by they go near and follow it from distance, dolphins can leap out of the water and do somersaults.Sometimes they invent their own tricks and stunts after watching other dolphins perform.

                                            Text 2I'm really interested in the dolphins. They are one of the most playful and intelligent animals. Eventhough dolphins spend their lives in the water, they are not fish. They are mammals. Dolphinscan't breathe in the water like fish, but need to come to the surface to breathe the air.Dolphins eat other smaller fish and squid. Some dolphins,like Killer Whales, will often eat small sea mammals like sealsand penguins. Dolphins often hunt together. Some dolphinswill share their food with the young. They don't chew theirfood. They swallow it whole. Dolphins get the water they needfrom the animals they eat, rather than drinking ocean water.Dolphins have excellent eyesight and hearing. Underthe water, they use echolocation. Echolocation is kind of likesonar where dolphins make a sound and then listen to theecho. Dolphin is also tame animal that people can play withTerjemahkan kedalam bahasa Indonesia​</a>

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p>The text above is an informational text about dolphins.The text mostly uses the present tense to describe dolphins and their characteristics, but also uses the past tense to describe people's previous beliefs about animal intelligence.The text states that dolphins are mammals, not fish.Talking to dolphins is not easy because they have a language that is difficult for humans to understand and reproduce, and because they live in a different environment than humans (the sea) and may not be able to communicate in the same way as humans do.According to the text, dolphins have a simple language that allows them to talk to one another, are friendly toward humans, and are able to guide ships through difficult and dangerous waters. Additionally, the text suggests that dolphins may be very intelligent and may even be cleverer than some animals previously believed to be the most intelligent (such as chimpanzees).<p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            22. kk tolong bantuin dong kak pliss.Dolphins are mammals in the order Cetacea. They are part of the toothed whales. Generally, they are among the smaller whales. Most live in salt water oceans, but some live in rivers – there are oceanic dolphins and river dolphins. Dolphins are from 1.5 to 4 metres (4.5 ft to 13 ft) long. The Killer whale is the largest of the group, and can be about 8 metres (26 ft).The name 'dolphin' comes from the Ancient Greek δελφίς (delphis) meaning "with a womb", because it was first thought to be a fish with a womb. It is now known to be a mammal, and quite an intelligent mammal. Dolphins breathe air. A dolphin's nose is on top of its head so the dolphin can easily breathe on the surface of the water. The skin of a dolphin has no scales. It is soft and smooth. However, it is very firm, due to how much muscle they have. Dolphins use echolocation to find their food.Dolphins swim in 'pods'; a very large pod is called a herd. They are very social and help each other fight off predators. Dolphins have fought off sharks in this way. They can kill large sharks by ramming them over and over again with their snouts and heads. They look after the young when the mothers that need to leave their calves to hunt for food. The young need to breathe more often than the adults, and the food may be in deeper waters.Oceanic dolphins are marine animals living in the sea. They live in all of the oceans. Three of the four species of river dolphins live in fresh water rivers. The La Plata Dolphin lives in saltwater estuaries and the ocean. Water pollution and the loss of habitat are a threat to some dolphins, especially those living in rivers and estuaries.Dolphins do not sleep in a normal way. They have two sides of their brain, which they use to sleep. One side sleeps, while the other side stays awake. They will keep one eye open to watch for predators while they sleep.Dolphins (and other cetaceans) sleep in the water.[1] There is danger from sharks.[2] While sleeping in water, the animals go through different stages of sleep. They do some behaviours during sleep: they come to the surface occasionally to breathe, and they have an eye open most of the time.[1] The details vary in different species or groups. Predator detection is the obvious function of this behaviour. Similar adaptations are found in pinnipeds like seals.[1]The brain of a dolphin is like a human brain in size and development. Dolphins have reasonable eyesight. They can watch a thing in the water, and they can see colors, too. They can also see in dark places.A dolphin's hearing is better than their sight. There are small holes behind the eyes, and they are the ears of a dolphin. Dolphins can hear a sound underwater.

   Dolphins have smooth skin. Only baby dolphins are born with a few bristly hairs on their snouts. Their hair soon fall out. They have big tail and the fin on the top of their backs keep the dolphin from rolling over. The female dolphins have a thick layer of fat under their skin to keep the warm when they dive very deep. The dolphin's front fins are called flippers. They use them to turn left and right. Dolphins grow from 2 to 3 meters long and weight up to 75 kilograms. 
   Dolphins hunt together in a group. A group of dolphins is called a pod. They eat fish, shrimps, and small squids. They live in salt water oceans. When dolphins fear or see a ship close by they go near and follow it from distance, dolphins can leap out of the water and do somersaults.Sometimes they invent their own tricks and stunts after watching other dolphins perform.

                            38. Text 2I'm really interested in the dolphins. They are one of the most playful and intelligent animals. Eventhough dolphins spend their lives in the water, they are not fish. They are mammals. Dolphinscan't breathe in the water like fish, but need to come to the surface to breathe the air.Dolphins eat other smaller fish and squid. Some dolphins,like Killer Whales, will often eat small sea mammals like sealsand penguins. Dolphins often hunt together. Some dolphinswill share their food with the young. They don't chew theirfood. They swallow it whole. Dolphins get the water they needfrom the animals they eat, rather than drinking ocean water.Dolphins have excellent eyesight and hearing. Underthe water, they use echolocation. Echolocation is kind of likesonar where dolphins make a sound and then listen to theecho. Dolphin is also tame animal that people can play withTerjemahkan kedalam bahasa Indonesia​</h2><br />

                            39. Although a dolphin lives in the sea, it is not a fish. It is a mammal. It is in many ways, therefore, like a human being. It breathes air. Dolphins do not lay eggs but they give birth to their young. Dolphins have a simple language. They are able to talk to one another. It may be possible for man to learn how to talk to dolphins. But this will not be easy because dolphin cannot hear the kind of sound man can make. If man wants to talk to dolphins, therefore, he will have to make a third language which both he and the dolphins can understand. Dolphins are also very friendly towards man. They often follow ships. There are many stories about dolphins guiding ships through difficult and dangerous waters.What do you think?1. Tell what you know about the picture.2. Where can you find it? 3.
